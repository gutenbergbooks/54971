<span>HOW IT ALL STARTED</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Jean Gordon</span> rushed into the house, her face
all aglow. There was some fire within which
made her eyes bright and the sharp wind, which
came from lakes not too far away, gave her
rosy cheeks and nipped her nose as well.</p>

<p>Without stopping in the hall to take off her
pretty red coat or the close little hat that left
little but eyes, nose and mouth to be seen, she
opened the door into the dining-room, from
which the sound of her mother’s machine could
be heard.</p>

<p>“O Mother! May I have the room in the attic
for a club room?”</p>

<p>Jean had opened this door a little more decorously
and now she closed it more softly than
she had opened and closed the front door, whose
bang her mother must have heard. With an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">4</a></span>
amused smile Mrs. Gordon turned from her
work. “Is this my dear hurricane, home from
school?”</p>

<p>“It is,” laughed Jean. “Please excuse the
front door, Mother. It slipped out of my hand.
And I suppose I should not have shouted right
out. Good afternoon, fair lady!” A deep courtesy
was made in grave exaggeration before
Jean ran to her mother and deposited a quick
kiss upon her cheek.</p>

<p>“Your apology is accepted, Miss Gordon,”
said Jean’s mother, with a pat upon the cold
hand which Jean laid upon her chair. “Now,
what is it that you want?”</p>

<p>“The attic room for a club,&mdash;please, Mother!”</p>

<p>“It is cold up there,” returned Mrs. Gordon,
starting to baste the hem of a blouse which she
was making for Jean.</p>

<p>“Oh, that is going to be precious!” exclaimed
Jean, stopping to look at the garment. “I’ll
be all fixed for school now. I don’t see what
makes me get so shabby.”</p>

<p>“Nor do I,” said Mrs. Gordon with a comical
look. “But clothes will wear out.”</p>

<p>Jean sat on the arm of her mother’s chair
to continue the original subject. “There’s a
radiator there, isn’t there, Mother? Couldn’t
the heat be turned on?”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">5</a></span>
“I suppose so; but that one always turned
hard, and it has not been used for a long time.
But why the pressing need of a club room and
who will clean it?”</p>

<p>Jean laughed. “Ay, there’s the <em>rub</em>! I hope
you appreciate my smart remark, Mother. But
March is almost time for house-cleaning, isn’t
it? Besides, the club members will fix up the
room. I promise not to bother you about it.
There isn’t much in it. Why couldn’t we have
the old chairs that are in the rest of the attic?”</p>

<p>“You could. You <em>may</em>. Tell me about the
club. This is something new, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Rather; but if you don’t mind, Mother, I’ll
tell you more about it tonight. There is a
reason why I have to call up the girls <i>right
away</i>!”</p>

<p>“Run along, then.” Mrs. Gordon looked after
her daughter with a twinkle in the brown eyes
that were so much like Jean’s. What new
scheme did those children have now?</p>

<p>Jean pulled off her hat and hung it upon the
hall rack, but without removing her coat she
sat down at the little table near to telephone.</p>

<p>“No, Central, it’s one&mdash;O&mdash;two&mdash;O, please,&mdash;yes,
X.”</p>

<p>A long pause made Jean tap her feet impatiently
while she waited. Why didn’t Central<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">6</a></span>
ring again? But here came the “hello” Jean
wanted. “Hello, Molly. I’m glad that’s you.
Can you call up Phoebe and Bess and Fran for
me and all of you come right over? There’s
something I have to see you about right away.
It’s terribly important and I want to get everybody
here the first minute possible, or I
wouldn’t ask you to telephone. I’ve just <em>got</em> to
see you before the party tonight! Oh, good!
Thank you <em>so</em> much. Tell them there’s a mystery
and that’ll bring ’em. I’m going to get
Nan over and start making fudge. Wasn’t it
<em>grand</em> that we got out of school so early?”</p>

<p>Molly evidently agreed that it was “grand,”
and in a moment the receiver was hung up, Jean
hanging up her coat in the interval between
calls.</p>

<p>Again Jean was sitting at the small table.
“That you, Nan? Since I saw you something
has happened and if you want your old Jean
vindicated, as ’twere, come on over and help
me out. Just walk right in, because I’ll probably
be telephoning, or may be, anyhow. We’ll
make some fudge before the girls get here.
What? Oh, I’ll ‘splain’ when you get here.
I’ve a great scheme,&mdash;only maybe you won’t
like it, of course.”</p>

<p>Nan must have asserted her interest in Jean’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">7</a></span>
schemes, for Jean turned from the telephone
with a dimple in one cheek fully evident and a
funny quirk in her smile. Nan was her chum
in chief, and a girl of some originality. What
Jean could not think of, Nan proposed. Between
them had some interesting experiences, though
usually within the bounds imposed by their very
sensible parents.</p>

<p>Next, a number had to be looked up. “I do
hate to call the Dudley’s,” Jean was thinking.
She stood a moment, thinking, then went on a
run through the hall and into the kitchen, neat
and clean and orderly. Jean made a dash for
the aluminum sauce-pan in which she always
made her fudge. Another dash, and she had
measured out the sugar, put a cup under the
faucet for water, set out another pan, to receive
the fudge when done, a bottle of flavoring extract
and a big spoon. Then she looked for
milk and butter, changing her mind a time or
two about the ingredients.</p>

<p>While Jean was in the midst of these hurried
proceedings, the kitchen door opened after
a short rap and a girl with a blue coat over her
head and shoulders came in, though stopping
in the door to take off her rubbers. “My, it’s
muddy in your back yard, Jean,” said she. “I
just took a notion to come over this way, since<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">8</a></span>
you said fudge. Why aren’t you telephoning?”</p>

<p>The enveloping coat came off as Nan Standish
talked, revealing a girl of about Jean’s
height, the usual height of girls about fifteen.
Nan’s clear eyes were blue and her hair fluffy
and yellow. She was as light on her feet as
Jean and came dancing over to where Jean
stood. “Here, just skeedoodle, Jean Gordon.
I’ll start this, while you do whatever else you
want to do. I’m dying to know what it’s all
about.”</p>

<p>“I’ve only got one more place to telephone,
Nan. I’ve decided to use milk instead of water,
since there seems to be plenty. So put in one
cup to the three cups of sugar, already measured.
See? I’ll be back in a minute and tell
you all about it, the plan, I mean, not the
fudge.”</p>

<p>“Yes, I’ve made fudge with you before. Trot
along.”</p>

<p>Jean trotted. “Is this Mrs. Dudley?” she
asked, when she had the proper number. “This
is Jean Gordon. Would it be too much trouble
to ask Leigh to come to the telephone?”</p>

<p>Jean’s tone was very formal now. She did
not know Mrs. Dudley very well, and she stood
just a little in awe of the Dudley formality as
expressed in Leigh. But Phoebe would not enjoy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">9</a></span>
a club without Leigh, and Leigh was a girl
that any club would be glad to have. To do
without Phoebe, too, was not to be thought of!</p>

<p>It was plainly not too much trouble to notify
Leigh, for presently she came to talk with Jean.
“A little meeting of a few girls, Jean,&mdash;to do
something about something? That’s very
clear!” Leigh’s low laugh came over the wire.
“Why the mystery? Yes, of course, I’ll come,
and stop for Phoebe, too. Oh, it may be fifteen
minutes. I’ll have to tell Mother and get my
wraps. I’m terribly curious.”</p>

<p>“Wasn’t that nice, Nan?” asked Jean, in the
kitchen again. “Phoebe told me yesterday that
Leigh is just shy, being new here this year, you
know, and not knowing any of the girls before.”</p>

<p>“We-ell,” Nan replied, with a spoonful of the
hot fudge to try it in a glass of cold water, “I
do think that the Dudleys think pretty well of
themselves, with that big place and all,&mdash;but I
suppose, for that matter, all of our families do,
and Leigh&mdash;gracious, Jean, this fudge is ready
to come off! Is that the pan of cold water to
set this in?”</p>

<p>The fudge cooling before being beaten, our
two girls linked arms and ran upstairs to Jean’s
room, where with many giggles Jean imparted
her news to her friend. “Do you think it was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">10</a></span>
so awful, Nan?” she asked. “I feel dreadfully
guilty, yet I just did it on the spur of the moment
and if you girls only do it, it will be a lot
of fun.”</p>

<p>“Of course it will. I’m for it, Jean. Why
haven’t we done it before?”</p>

<p>“But how about the name? Do you suppose&mdash;?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that will be all right. If I were you I’d
tell them all about it. What is a secret society
without a secret to keep? Jimmy has been
awfully smart about his pin, and if we <em>could</em>
keep it quiet about our plans&mdash;”</p>

<p>“Especially as we haven’t any,” laughed
Jean.</p>

<p>“Yes, but they need not know that. Oh,
there’s the doorbell! The girls are coming. I’ll
slip down the back stairs and beat that fudge
while you let them all in. But don’t do anything
till I get there,&mdash;<em>please</em>!”</p>

<p>“Not a word, Nan. It shall remain a mystery
till you come in. But don’t you want some help
beating that fudge?”</p>

<p>“Not <em>necessarily</em>, Jean, but send anybody out
you like.”</p>

<p>By this time Jean was at the foot of the front
stairs to open the door, and Nan’s quick feet
were pattering down the uncarpeted back stairs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">11</a></span>
to the kitchen. The Gordon home was almost
like her own.</p>

<p>The last girl to be reached by telephone was
the first to arrive. Leigh Dudley and Phoebe
Wood stood at the Gordon door, giving bright
greetings to Jean’s welcoming words. “Come
right in,” she cordially urged. “Isn’t this a
March wind, though?”</p>

<p>Leigh was taller than Jean, with a vivid color,
almost black hair and dark blue eyes. She
slipped out of a handsome fur coat, which Jean
took from her and put upon a hanger. Phoebe,
little and dark and quick, waited upon herself.
A wood fire was burning in the living room fireplace
and to this the girls betook themselves,
warming cold hands.</p>

<p>As Leigh rubbed her hands together in front
of the blaze, she said, “I thought at first that
you wanted us for something about the party.
Phoebe thought it a birthday party. Do you
suppose we ought to give a present?”</p>

<p>“No,” replied Jean. “I know that it is not
a birthday celebration. Excuse me,&mdash;there come
Molly with Bess and Fran. Oh, look at Fran’s
new hat. Isn’t it <em>darling</em>?”</p>

<p>With this Jean flew to the hall again, while
Leigh and Phoebe looked out of the window to
behold the “darling” hat, a very cocky felt affair.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">12</a></span>
Only girls could have told any difference
in the style from those of the other girls. “Isn’t
it a shame that Fran had to get a new hat this
late in the winter?” asked Phoebe.</p>

<p>“Why did she? They’re wearing straw hats
now in some places.”</p>

<p>“Why, don’t you know, on the bob-sled last
night Fran’s hat got knocked off and Jimmy
Standish stepped right into it and through it!
Fran managed to fix it up enough to wear to
school this morning. Then at noon Fran went
and got a wonderful bargain because it is so
late.”</p>

<p>More raw breezes entered with the newcomers,
who talked about how the snow had
turned to slush and how raw the wind was and
how Fran would have her hat for “next fall”
if the styles didn’t change. Then Nan came in
with a plate of fudge, divided into squares and
still hot. “Your mother came out and gave me
the plate, Jean,” said she.</p>

<p>The girls ate fudge and toasted their toes by
the fire. Molly French was a plump, happy
looking girl with a way of looking at one and
considering a moment before she spoke. “Molly
always thinks twice before she speaks,” said
the girls sometimes. But then Molly was “the
preacher’s” daughter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">13</a></span>
Frances Lockhart was as tall as Leigh and
very thin. But her features were good and her
humor so jolly that even if her clothes usually
hung on her, as she herself declared, “Fran”
was very popular in her class at school, as well
as with other young friends. Bess or Elizabeth
Crane had grown up “next door” to Frances,
as Nan and Jean had lived. Now both girls
were united in an admiration and friendship
that bound them to the capable and friendly
Molly, whose father was their minister. There
was nothing particularly remarkable about the
appearance of Bess. Brown hair, hazel eyes,
a nose inclined to turn up a trifle and a slight
figure as graceful as Fran’s was awkward, were
what one would observe as Bess entered the
room.</p>

<p>Like so many butterflies settling after uncertain
movements, Jean’s guests turned from the
closer proximity to the fire and took seats.
Four of them bounced on the cushion-covered
springs of the big davenport that was placed
at an angle where the cozy warmth of the fire
reached them. Leigh sank into a big over-stuffed
chair. Nan perched on its arm, as she
happened to be near with the plate of fudge,
just passed again. Jean, now thinking thoughts
of new presidents or promoters of clubs, stood<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">14</a></span>
with her hand on one end of the mantel and
surveyed the girls with a smile half embarrassed.</p>

<p>“What’s the great excitement, Jean?” asked
practical Molly, tossing back a flaxen bob and
leaning forward on the davenport, with her
hands around one knee. “What scheme have
you and Nan gotten up now?”</p>

<p>Blue eyes and brown eyes exchanged an
amused look, though Jean grew rather sober,
while Nan spoke up. “I haven’t a thing to do
with this one, except to stand by Jean. She’ll
explain.”</p>

<p>“All right. Explain and satisfy our curiosity,
Jean, or else forever after hold your peace!”</p>

<p>“There must have been a wedding at the parsonage,
girls,” suggested Fran. “Were you a
witness, Molly?”</p>

<p>“Not this time. Go on, Jean, and tell. I have
to get home early and help get supper.”</p>

<p>“All right, Molly. I’m just thinking it out.
This is a ‘S. O. S.’ call girls, and if you don’t
help me out, I’m disgraced for life, I guess.”</p>

<p>“It is <em>very</em> serious,” remarked Nan, with
mock soberness and an air as important as she
could manage while still holding the fudge
plate, sadly depleted.</p>

<span>SEVEN S. P.’S</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Jean</span> now drew up a straight chair and sat
down, facing the others from the other corner
of the mantel. Then she began, soberly at first,
but frequently displaying her pretty dimple in
smiles, chuckles and even grins as her story
proceeded.</p>

<p>“It’s this way, girls. We just&mdash;simply&mdash;have
to have a club, and I don’t mean an ordinary
club or society, but something different,
a <em>secret</em> club!”</p>

<p>“Sakes!” exclaimed Molly, “something like
Grace’s sorority at college?”</p>

<p>“No. That wouldn’t be any fun for us. Well,
perhaps. But have you noticed how mysterious
some of the boys have been lately?”</p>

<p>Several girls said that they had not seen anything
unusual. Leigh remarked that she never
paid any attention to what they did, except at
parties. But Molly remembered that when they
were skating recently “a knot of the boys” drew
together, talking about something and that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">16</a></span>
when she and Bess happened to skate near
them, to avoid a rough place in the ice, “the
bunch” broke up and skated apart.</p>

<p>“How about Jimmy, Nan?” asked Molly.</p>

<p>“He’s in it, but the first I noticed was his
new pin, this morning, though he may have
been wearing it before, out of sight. When I
asked him about it, he said, ‘Oh nothing. Bottle
up your curiosity, Nan’!”</p>

<p>This called forth various comments on brothers
and whether the boys’ club was a senior
fraternity or not. Jean waited till the opportunity
came.</p>

<p>“No, it can’t be a real fraternity,” said she,
“for they aren’t allowed. Besides Billy Baxter
belongs and he’s only a sophomore, like us. Nobody
wants to know, of course, just what boys
do; but this time they have gotten up some sort
of a secret society and feel so snippy about it
that we just ought to do something, too.”</p>

<p>“And be called ‘copy-cats’,” Nan suggested.</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s so,” acknowledged Jean. “But
just wait a minute. Perhaps you won’t think
that what I did was so terrible, then; for I
thought of that, too. Billy, you know, comes
home my way from school, and tonight he whistled
and called ‘Je-an,’ and caught up with me.
Well, in a minute I knew it wasn’t for anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">17</a></span>
else than to show me his new pin and crow over
us girls a little. I didn’t know about Jimmy,
of course, and there must be several sophomores
in it, I’m sure. We’ll have to find out how big
a crowd belongs.” A wide grin now almost obscured
the dimple in Jean’s cheek.</p>

<p>“Girls, they call themselves ‘The Black Wizards’
and their pin is a most terrible lookin’
snake in a queer W! Billy was full of it, and
by a few little innocent questions I got a lot
of news! I wasn’t pretending either, when I
told him that I was awfully interested, and that
it must be fine and lots of fun. I imagine that
they must have made it up to wear their pins,&mdash;they’d
just come,&mdash;and not keep <em>everything</em> to
themselves any longer.</p>

<p>“So I said, ‘Why isn’t that <em>grand</em>,&mdash;just like
us girls, only, only we haven’t such a <a name="scary" id="scary"></a><ins title="Original has 'scarey'">scary</ins>
sign as a snake, and our pins haven’t come yet!’”
With this Jean looked around with an expression
like that of the cat after it had eaten the
canary.</p>

<p>“Oh, you whopper-teller!” cried Molly. “And
did you say it after he told you they wouldn’t
keep the fact of their having a club secret any
longer?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no! I put that in just now. He just
said that the boys had a new club, and told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">18</a></span>
the name and how they had lots of great plans
and things like that. What I said wasn’t exactly
untrue, for I formed a club of one member
then and there, and I felt pretty sure that
Nan would help me out, so I could say ‘girls,’&mdash;and
Billy was gloating so!</p>

<p>“There isn’t a thing in this little town like
Girl Scouts or Camp Fire Girls or anything,
and nobody to start them. Don’t <em>you</em> think that
we ought to have something besides the school
societies and the church things, Molly?”</p>

<p>Molly gave Jean a look of amusement. “It
would be fun,” she answered.</p>

<p>“It’s a jolly idea,” said Fran decisively. “Go
on, Jean. What else did you and Billy say?”</p>

<p>“Of course Billy wouldn’t believe me. ‘You’re
just kidding,’ he said. ‘But if we get up a secret
club, of <em>course</em> you <em>girls</em> would have to
have one, too! What’s the name of yours, if
you <em>have</em> one?’ I could see that he was <i>real
suspicious</i>, and I didn’t blame him. It did <em>look</em>
suspicious!”</p>

<p>Nan almost fell off the arm of Leigh’s chair
at this, and the fudge plate tilted precariously.
“I should think it did!” she cried.</p>

<p>While the girls laughed, Jean dimpled and
rose to take the fudge plate from Nan, passing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">19</a></span>
it around once more. Placing the plate upon
the mantel, she continued:</p>

<p>“‘It isn’t best to tell our name yet,’ I said
to Billy. ‘It’s sort of secret, too’.”</p>

<p>“I should say so!” gasped Leigh.</p>

<p>“Sh-sh,” said Phoebe. “Let Jean tell it.”</p>

<p>“Billy said much the same thing, Leigh,”
laughed Jean. “He said, ‘<em>Yes</em> it is!&mdash;’cause
you haven’t any!’</p>

<p>“‘I’ll tell you the initials,’ I said,&mdash;thinking
awfully fast, girls! But I couldn’t seem to think
of a thing but ‘Busy Bees’ or ‘Happy Hearts’
or something like that. Just then we passed a
sign that said ‘S. P. Smith,’ so I tossed my
head a little and said, ‘They’re S. P. What do
you think of that, now?’ I was getting in deeper
and deeper, you see.”</p>

<p>“‘H’m,’ he said, ‘what are you going to do?’</p>

<p>“‘That,’ I said, ‘is sort of a secret, too. You
never heard of a secret society that told everything,
did you? We may tell our name later,
though.’</p>

<p>“‘It won’t be long,’ Billy said.</p>

<p>“‘Now isn’t that mean of you?’ I asked.”
Jean lifted her chin and looked sidewise at
Leigh as she had doubtless scanned Billy.</p>

<p>“He asked me where our club met and I said,
‘Most anywhere yet, but headquarters is at our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">20</a></span>
house.’ Billy didn’t say anything for a minute.
Billy is terribly smart, you know, and it
looked fishy to him,&mdash;naturally! Still, some of
us have been meeting occasionally, you know.</p>

<p>“Then he said, ‘Well, all I have to say is that
it’s awfully funny we never heard anything of
it before this. Girls can’t keep a secret!’”</p>

<p>“‘Oh, <em>can’t</em> we?’ I asked. Then Billy looked
at me and laughed, and I laughed, and he broke
a peanut chocolate bar into two pieces and gave
me the biggest,&mdash;bigger, I mean; so he wasn’t
mad, of course. But by this time Danny Pierce
was coming along on the other side of the
street, and looked over with a grin,&mdash;and that
finished Billy. You know how he feels about
being seen with a girl! So he never said goodbye
or anything but bolted across to Danny. I’m
sure he’ll tell Danny about our club, so you see
what I’ve gotten us into. But there’s one thing
that will save you, if you don’t want to come to
my rescue,&mdash;Billy didn’t ask me who belonged.</p>

<p>“I rushed home and asked Mother if I could
have the finished room in the attic for a club
room and that is all right. Now will any of you
stand by me, or do I have to be a club all by
myself?”</p>

<p>“You forget me, Jean,” Nan reminded her.
“I promised to be a S. P. S. P. forever!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">21</a></span>
Molly jumped to her feet. “All in favor of
being an S. P. stand up!”</p>

<p>Every girl responded and Leigh, of whom
Jean had been most in doubt, laughingly announced
that she wouldn’t miss it for anything.
“Let’s have <em>sweet</em> pins,” she added. “A snake
would be dreadful,&mdash;Ugh!”</p>

<p>“No, really, Leigh, their pins are pretty,”
said Nan, “gold with a little black enamel, and
Jim said that when they could afford it they
might have rubies for the snakes’ eyes. That
was when I looked at his pin.”</p>

<p>“The ‘Black Wizards!’ Wow!” exclaimed
Bess. “Let’s elect Jean president, and Nan
secretary, and Leigh would make a good treasurer,
as her father’s president of the bank now.
I’m a nominating committee!”</p>

<p>The girls agreed that Bess’s suggestions
were good. Bess, Fran and Phoebe were appointed
a committee on what the club should
do, and every one was to consider herself a
committee to determine what S. P. should represent.
“S. could stand for Sophomore,” Molly
suggested. Molly had begged off from any
office, as she had so many church organizations
to help.</p>

<p>“Sophomore is too common, Molly,” said
Phoebe. “There are exactly seven of us, too,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">22</a></span>
and seven is a lucky number. But I think that
we can tell better after we think up what would
be fun to do. Could we see the attic, Jean?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I’ll ask Mother, though, first. And
don’t you think that we are enough right now,
or would you rather ask more girls at once?”</p>

<p>For several minutes the girls talked that matter
over, finally concluding that for the present,
though they had many other friends, it would
be better to keep the number as it stood. The
sophomore class was not large. If they wanted
to mix the group, as the boys were doing, there
would be time enough. As Jean well knew,
these were the leading girls of her class.</p>

<p>She slipped out to consult her mother, who
gave permission at once for the girls to visit
the attic and “view the landscape o’er,” as
Molly said. Mrs. Gordon came into the living
room to meet the girls and advised them to
wear their coats into the cold regions and to
look out for dust. “We do not dust the attic
every day,” she added, with a smile like Jean’s.</p>

<p>The seven S. P.’s accordingly trooped up the
two flights of stairs to the attic, or third floor.
As they rounded the post at the top of an enclosed
stairway, they found themselves in a
large space dimly lighted by one window at the
head of the stairs. The whole attic, to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">23</a></span>
farthermost corners, stretched before them.
Dusty, shrouded shapes stood here and there.
A great chimney went up through the middle,
showing some of the sooty dust that had also
sprinkled down from somewhere upon draped
furniture or old trunks. Jean warned the girls
again about dust, but no one cared.</p>

<p>At the front of this third floor a gable and
a room of good height had been finished, separated
by partitions and a door from the rest
of the “attic.” The door was not far from the
stairs and Jean explained that her father intended
to make a hall there some day, shutting
off the unfinished part by another partition
and door. “But there’s no use in doing it,
Mother says, for we’ll never need to use this
room, and that’s why it will be just the thing
for us. I suppose we can use the whole attic
if we want to. We could have a lovely party
up here some day. And I never even thought
of it before!”</p>

<p>“Before your necessity became the ‘mother
of invention,’ Jean.”</p>

<p>“That’s so, and ‘one thing leads to another’!”</p>

<p>Keen young eyes surveyed the proposed club
room and found possibilities. A covered couch
ran along one wall. Several good pieces of
furniture stood about. The room was about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">24</a></span>
fifteen feet in one direction, though it would
have been hard to give its actual dimensions,
so broken up was it into nooks and corners.
Jean threw open the door of an immense closet
and explained that the house had once been a
big country house and that this room had been
occupied by two maids.</p>

<p>“It is the very place, Jean!” cried cheery
Fran. “How soon can we fix it up? I have a
lot of ideas already!”</p>

<p>“Mother will have to see if the heat will turn
on, though there is a place for a little stove, you
see, if the furnace won’t heat us. I’ll let you
know; but we ought to have another meeting
soon.”</p>

<p>“Come to our house Saturday, girls,” Leigh
invited. “We haven’t a lovely attic like this,
but we can meet in my big room all to ourselves.”</p>

<p>This was a good suggestion. Leigh was
warming up, the girls thought, and Phoebe
knew that it was the opportunity Leigh wanted
to do something for them without appearing to
thrust herself into their affairs, a thing about
which she was sensitive. A club would be just
the thing for Leigh.</p>

<p>Nan suggested that it would be a good thing
to make no reference to S. P. affairs, or appear<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">25</a></span>
to be concerned about anything private, to
“show Billy that girls could have something going
on without their making a great fuss about
it.”</p>

<p>Fran took a little exception to this. “Don’t
you think that once or twice we ought to be
saying something and then stop suddenly till
we get past some of the boys?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Fran, if you will do that, I’ll be&mdash;a&mdash;vindicated,
and your friend forever! Thanks muchly,
girls, for going into this! Now do rack your
brains to think of a good S. P. name, even if
we should want to change it after a while.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, Jean. S. P. can mean something,
I’m sure. We’ll put on our thinking
caps till Saturday and longer if necessary.
Still, Jean, if we can’t think of anything, nobody
will know the difference!” And this was
Leigh Dudley, over inviting whom Jean had
hesitated, not sure that Leigh would be at all
interested!</p>

<h2><a name="iii" id="iii"></a>CHAPTER III<br />
<span>SHAMROCKS</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> party that night was given by one of the
senior girls and was quite general. Nearly all
of the girls in the small high school were there
and many of the boys, with some who had been
graduated or stopped to go to work in some
store or business.</p>

<p>The town was small. Originally a community
formed in a farming district not far from Lake
Michigan, it was populated by people who were
intelligent and of good standing. But a big
railroad had diverted its main line from the
town and a larger town, with manufacturing interests
had absorbed such growth as this village
might have had. The school was good, but
small.</p>

<p>As Jean had said, there was no organization
for girls outside of the school literary clubs and
the church societies. These were excellent in
their lines, but girls bubbling over with activity
wanted something else. So did the boys and the
“Black Wizards” were created.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">27</a></span>
The party proved to be an advance St. Patrick’s
Day celebration. The house was appropriately
decorated and one of the senior
girls stood at the foot of the stairs to pin on
each girl and boy, as they came from leaving
wraps in the respective rooms, a bright green
shamrock. A March wind blustered outside,
but it was bright and warm within.</p>

<p>“I’d forgotten that tomorrow is St. Patrick’s
Day,” said Jean to Nan, with whom she had
come. Jimmy had gotten to the stage when he
escorted one of the girls to the party. Most of
the younger ones let the girls come by themselves,
yet took them home. But Jimmy Standish
was more or less devoted now to a very
pretty senior, Clare Miller, and permitted Nan
to make any arrangements she liked about being
escorted to this or any other party. Sisters
were of secondary importance, as Nan told
Jean.</p>

<p>“I’d have worn my green frock, if I’d
known,” replied Nan, “but this blue one is more
becoming. I love your orchid, Jean.”</p>

<p>Jean adjusted her bracelet and repinned her
shamrock a little self-consciously, for Billy
Baxter was making straight for her and some
one of the girls drew Nan away at that moment.
“Hello, S. P.,” said Billy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">28</a></span>
“Oh, Billy, please,” said Jean, putting her
finger to her lips. “I told you that in confidence.
We’re not a bit ready to have that get
around!”</p>

<p>Billy grinned, and Jean was surprised to see
that he was really pleased, probably over knowing
something that the other boys had not been
told. “I hope you didn’t tell Danny Pierce
what I said,” Jean continued.</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t,” returned Billy, glad that an
accident had saved him from imparting the
news which he would have had no hesitation in
passing on. Jean hadn’t told him not to tell.
But Danny had had something to tell Billy;
then they had met some other Black Wizards
with great schemes afoot. “<em>I</em> told <em>you</em> things
I oughtn’t to’ve,” said Billy, “so we’re even.
But we’re all wearing our pins right out to-night,
you see. And say, Jean, may I see you
home to-night after it’s over?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Billy, of course. But please don’t say
S. P. till I give you leave.”</p>

<p>“All right. But who belong, Jean?”</p>

<p>“Sh-sh! I’ll tell you to-morrow if I see you
when no one’s around.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Billy again. “Don’t you
kind of like our pins, Jean?”</p>

<p>“They’re stunning, Billy&mdash;even if I am<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">29</a></span>
scared of snakes; and I think that ‘Black Wizards’
is an awfully cute name. I suppose you
have some terrible initiation, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We have <em>some doings</em> at our meetings,
believe <em>me</em>, Jean.”</p>

<p>At that point Jean and Billy were summoned
to take part in a game that was being started
and Jean did not have any conversation with
him for some time. Yet Nan told her that he
“hovered” around, and one of the senior boys
tried to tease her by remarking that Billy Baxter
had gotten over his dislike for girls. “Is
that so?” she answered without confusion, recalling
that the senior had passed her and Billy
as they had been walking along together that
afternoon.</p>

<p>But Jean was wondering how, now that Billy
was pledged to silence, some knowledge of the
S. P.’s could “leak out”; for there would be no
fun unless the boys did know. She had not
thought of that when she was talking to Billy
this time. But perhaps some of the other girls
were managing better than she had done.</p>

<p>She threw herself into the games, however,
enjoying everything, as Jean always did, and
temporarily forgetting both Black Wizards and
S. P.’s. The scene was gay with the decorations,
the light dresses of the girls and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">30</a></span>
movement of the games. Once, when Jean was
waiting with others for a charade to be begun,
she stood by Fran and whispered the state of
things to her.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry. I’ll fix it,” said Fran with a
twinkle.</p>

<p>When the time came for the refreshments,
which were more elaborate on this occasion than
usual at the parties Jean had attended, she saw
that Fran was next to one of the boys who wore
the Black Wizard pin. She herself had found
her pretty place card between Billy and Danny.
Bess was on the other side of Danny, and once
she heard him exclaim, “Is that so? What do
you call it?” and she knew that Fran had passed
the word on to Bess.</p>

<p>It was a shame, though, to have started it the
way she had. What was it about “tangled
webs” when first we “practice to deceive”? But
there were to be no fibs. When they were looking
at the attic room, it had been decided that
if they were asked how long since their club
had been started they would answer “Not very
long.” More searching questions need not be
answered at all, and presently the club would
be taken as a matter of course. Such thoughts
as these ran through Jean’s mind and she ate
her green salad, nibbled the green frosting on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">31</a></span>
her cake or took a spoonful of green and white
brick ice-cream.</p>

<p>As a rule Jean acted on impulse first in
ordinary affairs; but most of her impulses had
been so far based on common sense she had
thought. Anyhow, a club would be fun.</p>

<p>There were more games after the late refreshments,
for the seniors were running this
party. Jean was both tired and sleepy, though
happy, when Billy took her through the sloppy
streets to her home. “Say, Jean, I noticed that
you had lost your shamrock in the games,” said
Billy, as they stepped upon the porch. “I want
you to take mine.” With this he threw open his
overcoat and unpinned the precious snake pin,
for the Black Wizards had put their badges
upon the shamrocks to make them more prominent,
a little while after arrival.</p>

<p>“You may as well pin it on with this, too,”
he added. “You can give it to me in the morning.
Goodnight, Jean.”</p>

<p>“Goodnight, Billy,” returned Jean, astonished
to find both shamrock and pin in her hand.
“Thanks.” But Billy was half way out of the
yard by that time.</p>

<p>A sleepy mother was waiting up for her, but
Jean shut her hand upon shamrock and pin.
That was a crazy thing for Billy to do! “Yes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">32</a></span>
Mother, we had a lovely time. Billy Baxter
brought me home, and Danny Pierce took Nan.
Most everybody was there. It was a St. Patrick’s
Day party and they had the best refreshments
and everything, a regular supper. Jimmy
took Clare and the seniors ran things. I’ll
tell you all about it to-morrow. There were
some of the older boys and girls not in school,
too. Oh, there must have been forty or fifty
there, I think,&mdash;maybe not so many. And
Mother, that was an S. P. meeting here yesterday
and I’m so delighted that we can have the
attic. Please don’t say anything about it.”</p>

<p>“I usually know more about a matter before
I talk about it, daughter,” said Mrs. Gordon.
“Get to bed as soon as possible, child. It is
such a pity to have a party in the middle of the
week. You will be too sleepy to study to-morrow.”</p>

<p>Jean was almost too sleepy to get up the
next morning, but she did not forget to pin on
the shamrock which Billy had given her. She
certainly owed him that little attention. The
snake pin she had under her coat ready, and
when she passed Billy’s house on the way to
school she found that he was waiting for her,
as she shrewdly judged, to receive the pin before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">33</a></span>
its absence should be noted by other Black
Wizards.</p>

<p>“I didn’t have sense enough to think that you
couldn’t wear the shamrock that late last
night,” Billy explained, rather sheepishly.
“Some day we’re going to give a party and
badge the girls we invite with our pins for the
evening. Jimmy Standish said that last night
and I was thinking of it as we went home.”</p>

<p>“Oh, that was all right, Billy. It was great
fun to have it and I’m wearing the shamrock,
you see, on my coat. I see Nan coming now
and I’ll just stroll back to meet her, I think.
There goes Danny. Do ask him if Bess told him
anything startling last night. I thought I heard
her say ‘S. P.’”</p>

<p>So Jean’s handling of the situation saved her
from walking to school with Billy and probably,
as she thought, saved him from some embarrassment.
It would also give Billy a chance
to say to Danny that he “knew it already,” if,
as she thought, Bess had told. Jean had not
exactly planned it, but instinctively she felt a
situation when it occurred.</p>

<p>The seven S. P.’s felt a little undercurrent
all day, but they avoided being together except
as they would usually meet, in twos or
threes. Once or twice conversation, not upon<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">34</a></span>
the S. P.’s at all, was suddenly stopped, as they
had planned.</p>

<p>Jean had really forgotten about having promised
to tell Billy about who belonged to the club,
till after school that afternoon Billy caught up
with her before she had left the school grounds
and took her books as Jimmy had just taken
Clare’s in front of them. He copied Jimmy’s
nonchalant air and said, “Excuse me, Nan,&mdash;I’ve
got to see Jean about something.”</p>

<p>Bess was just coming up behind them and
caught Nan’s arm, drawing her aside as Billy
and Jean walked on. Well, thought Jean,
maybe Billy hadn’t liked it that she hadn’t
walked to school with him that morning.</p>

<p>But Billy made no reference to that. “Jean,
it’s all over school about your club. The other
girls must have let it out.” So Billy began in
a low voice. “Before I said a word to Danny
he said, ‘So the girls have got a secret society,
too; I heard last night.’</p>

<p>“‘What did you hear?’ I asked. ‘Oh,’ he
said, ‘they’ve started something and all Bess
would tell me was the initials of their name,
the S. P.’s, and I suppose it stands for Sweet
Pickles or Sour Grapes or something like that.’</p>

<p>“I told him, of course, that I had heard about
it before, and that he’d better go slow on ‘Sour<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">35</a></span>
Grapes,’ because they were mighty nice girls
all right. But do tell me who they are, so I’ll
not be so ignorant the next time.”</p>

<p>Jean laughed heartily. “I don’t mind a bit.
That was cute of Danny. Why it’s Fran and
Bess and Molly, Phoebe and Leigh, and of
course Nan and I are in it. There are exactly
seven of us now, though it might be possible
that we’d take in some more girls later on. I
sort of think we ought to, when we carry out
one of the things I’ve been thinking of. I’m
president, Billy, and that’s everything I can
tell you.”</p>

<p>“I thought you would be, Jean,” said admiring
Billy. “You are great at getting up things.”</p>

<p>“Not half so good at it as Molly, or Nan
either, for that matter.”</p>

<p>“That will do for you to say, Jean. Come on,
Jimmy’s taking Clare into the delicatessen.
Let’s go, too.”</p>

<p>Jean wondered what was getting into Billy,
Billy the shy with girls. He was “certainly putting
coals of fire on her head,” though he did
not know it. But she had known Billy Baxter
all her life and it seemed very natural to sit at
the little table and sip a chocolate soda. They
left the subject of secret societies and talked
about the school teams, the prospect for baseball,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">36</a></span>
the plans for the new gym, how the old
town might wake up after a while, and who had
a new car. Jimmy Standish slapped Billy on
the shoulder as he passed him, going out with
Clare, and said, “Hello, Jean, how are the Seven
Peaches to-day?”</p>

<p>“I can’t imagine what you mean,” grinned
Jean, “but that’s a nice name.”</p>

<h2><a name="iv" id="iv"></a>CHAPTER IV<br />
<span>STEALTHY PROWLERS</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> happens sometimes that a sudden decision
has far-reaching consequences for good or evil.
On the other hand, an organization started upon
an impulse and with no particular purpose
might easily die an early death, with no special
consequences. It was probably due to the character
of these girls that their little club, so impulsively
formed, should bring them some
happy adventures, as well as some odd ones,
with a mystery of which they could have no
idea now.</p>

<p>There were two points about which the girls
were thinking: what they should do, and what
the S. P. should mean. Naturally it should have
some connection with the purpose of the club,
provided it was to have any. It was queer, Jean
said, how many things S. P. could mean. Who
would have thought of it? The boys missed no
opportunity to tease them by concocting different
combinations. Other girls asked Jean or
Nan what was going on and they explained, “It
is just a simple little club that we are beginning
to work on a little, and we are not telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">38</a></span>
much, about it yet. No, it isn’t a sorority and
won’t be like one.”</p>

<p>“I’ve made <em>more explanations</em>, Jean,” said
Molly, when they all met on Saturday at the
Dudley place, “and when there isn’t anything
much to explain, what can a body do? I do hope
nobody feels left out!”</p>

<p>“You couldn’t help that, Molly, if any one
wanted to feel that way, about any club. It
seems all right to me to have one and we’re
not going to act any different from before.
You’re an old dear, Molly, and you are used to
the church societies, where it’s come one come
all.”</p>

<p>“They are the best, then.”</p>

<p>“Of course they’re the best. As Dad says
sometimes, ‘You can’t start an argument with
me on that, Jean.’ The thing is&mdash;let’s see&mdash;‘self-evident’.”</p>

<p>But Molly enjoyed the fun as much as any
of the rest and it began at once. Saturday’s
meeting at the Dudley home was like another
party, Fran said. Jean, who had felt so shy
with Mrs. Dudley, was made to feel at home by
her cordial way of meeting the girls.</p>

<p>“So you are the young lady who started this
mysterious club, are you?” she asked. “Leigh
will not confide the name, only the initials. If<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">39</a></span>
there is anything that I can do to help the fun
along, let me know, Madam President!”</p>

<p>The bit of formality about Mrs. Dudley made
her only the more “fascinating,” Jean confided
to Nan later on; but the girls were taken at
once to Leigh’s own room, where they exclaimed
in little oh’s and ah’s over her pretty
arrangements. “Papa let me plan it,” said
Leigh, pleased that the girls liked her room.
“When he built the house he told Mamma and
me that we might as well have just exactly what
we had always wanted. So as I had wanted
certain things, I planned it out. Do you like
my long window-seat?”</p>

<p>“It’s like a real living room, Leigh,” said
Nan, “with your fireplace and mantel, and your
built-in bookcases. I love the <em>chaise longue</em>!
Here is the beautiful movie heroine, reclining
in her boudoir!”&mdash;and Nan gracefully sank into
the damask-covered arms of the article of furniture
mentioned, arranging imaginary draperies
over her feet.</p>

<p>“Don’t, Nan,” laughed Bess. “I’m growing
hilarious now and Leigh’s mother will be
shocked at our laughing so much, especially
when the secretary reads the names the S. P.’s
have been called.”</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about Mamma,” said Leigh.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">40</a></span>
“She thinks that I have not had enough fun
with the girls since I have been here; but you
all were such old friends that I felt,&mdash;well, you
know how a stranger would feel.”</p>

<p>“Especially a nice stranger like you,” warmly
said Jean. “But you are one of us now.”</p>

<p>No more time was lost. The president with
quite an air called the meeting to order, asking
at once for the report of the secretary. Nan,
still occupying the admired piece of furniture,
languidly read her report, which was so funny
that her hearers were convulsed. Nan had quite
a gift as scribe. No funny detail of how the
S. P.’s started was omitted. Shaking with repressed
laughter, they felt that they could not
miss a word and Jean’s voice shook as she said,
“You have heard the report of the secretary,”&mdash;then
she could not go on, and Molly moved that
it be accepted.</p>

<p>“We have had some valuable suggestions
from our friends, the Black Wizards,” ran the
report. “Some were complimentary, some quite
otherwise. In planning the charades for the
school party, Billy Baxter told Jean that he
would get all those Sweet Patooties, Smart
Prodigies, or Serpentine Pythons on his side,
and Jean told him that she did not mind being
called a sweet potato, but she drew the line on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">41</a></span>
being either a prodigy or a python. Mr. French
asked about the Serious Pedagogues and Judge
Gordon wanted to know more about the Seraphic
Peris. He had to explain to Jean that a
peri is a kind of fairy! But we feel that the
judge appreciates us.</p>

<p>“We have seen the boys double up over
some of their brilliant&mdash;interrogation point&mdash;thoughts
on S. P. and heard ourselves called
Some Pumpkins, Sweet Peas, Syrupy Pancakes,
Serious Problems, Sleepy Possums, Sour Persimmons,
Sappy Poets, Saucy Palmists, and by
our principal, who deigned to listen one time,
Soulful Psyches,&mdash;which wasn’t so bad.</p>

<p>“So if the S. P.’s wanted what the secretary’s
editor father calls ‘publicity,’ they have had it.
Father threatens, as it is, to write it up in the
paper.”</p>

<p>After the secretary’s report had been duly
accepted and Jean had remarked that she would
not call for a treasurer’s report, as there could
not possibly be any money in the treasury,
Phoebe, who sat on the floor near the fire, gave
a bit of advice.</p>

<p>“The funny part of Nan’s report, Jean, is her
write-up of you and Billy and your ‘reaction,’
as she calls it, to the news of the Black Wizards.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">42</a></span>
I’d advise you not to let Mr. Standish, or
Jimmy, get hold of it.”</p>

<p>“Jean needn’t worry, Phoebe,” said Nan.
“Father thinks all the stuff I write is silly, and
anyhow I destroyed all my notes. This new
S. P. notebook is to be kept locked up in my
desk.”</p>

<p>Bess, Fran and Phoebe, the committee on
what the S. P.’s should do, asked for a “general
discussion” first. Molly, by this time having
laid aside conscientious scruples about a
secret club, said that as far as she was concerned
she’d rather just have a good time.
That was a popular suggestion and was applauded.</p>

<p>Jean, however, said that you had to have
some program even for good times. “I can’t
think, for the life of me, any S. P. name that
will mean anything much, and if the rest of you
can’t let’s let it go right now. How would it do
for the present to fix up our attic for all sorts
of funny things, maybe witches’ quarters if the
boys have wizards. We could even give a party
there to all the boys and girls. Then Mother
suggested that when it gets too hot for meetings
in the attic we could be an <a name="outdoor" id="outdoor"></a><ins title="Original has 'oudoor'">outdoor</ins> club and
take hikes and do things that girls and boys do
now. We’ve been doing them anyhow, a little,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">43</a></span>
like our beach parties over on Michigan, and
our breakfast hikes to our own little lake. But
it would be lots more fun to do things as a club.”</p>

<p>“I have a lot of nature books, girls,” said
Leigh, brightening. “How would you like to
start a little library in our club room and read
up on what girls study in some of the camps?”</p>

<p>“Fine, Leigh!” exclaimed several girls. “We
ought to be up to date!” said Fran.</p>

<p>“I have a tree book,” said Molly. “I never
read it, though.”</p>

<p>“Molly’s turning frivolous,” said Phoebe.
“All she wants to do is to make fudge and be a
witch.”</p>

<p>Molly, surprised, looked at Phoebe to see if
she were being critical, but Phoebe’s grin reassured
her. “You have to be on too many programs
as it is, Molly, to want to improve yourself
outside of school,&mdash;isn’t that so?” Phoebe
continued, and Molly nodded.</p>

<p>“But I like hikes, Phoebe, and I really ought
to know what there is to see around town and
the lakes.”</p>

<p>“Let <em>me</em> tell you something,” said Bess. “As
I went down street on errands this morning I
met Miss Haynes. You ought to have seen her.
She had on old high shoes, an old hat and a
heavy sweater. Some sort of a case was swung<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">44</a></span>
around her shoulders and her pockets were
stuffed full of something. When she saw me
she just grinned, nodded and went on, and she
was headed out of town, toward the lake. Imagine,
on a day as damp and chilly as this! Of
course, <em>we</em> do it, whenever we feel like it, and
we skate and all in the winter; but she was going
all alone, and I just thought to myself, there
must be something to see, or she’d never go just
for her health or a walk. It’s muddy as anything
out that road.”</p>

<p>“More ideas!” cried Nan. “How would it do
for the committee to talk to Miss Haynes? She’s
the science teacher since Mr. Peters left and
maybe she’ll take us out on a hike. He did once
in our freshman year, only I think that he
didn’t know much about anything.”</p>

<p>“That was the reason they let him go, I
think,” wisely remarked Molly. “I imagine
Miss Haynes is getting ready for some field
work with the class.”</p>

<p>“I never heard of field work,” said Bess, “but
I’m for it! Hurrah for hikes and fires and food
and we can at least prowl around and pretend
to have an ‘object’.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Bess. That makes me think! You say
‘prowl around’,&mdash;why not Prowlers? S. Prowlers,&mdash;<em>what</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">45</a></span>
are prowlers, that begin with S?
Still&mdash;silent&mdash;searching&mdash;slinking&mdash;slippery.”</p>

<p>Jean paused for breath and Phoebe suggested
“sprightly,” or “stalking.”</p>

<p>“Get the dictionary, somebody,” laughed
Bess. “We’re going to ‘acquire a vocabulary,’
as our English teacher recommends, if we keep
on.”</p>

<p>“Steady,” continued Jean, still thinking, and
now clutching her hair in a pretense of great
concentration. “Aha! How about Stealthy?
The ‘Stealthy Prowlers’? That isn’t so bad, is
it? If we want to see any of the wild things
in the woods around the lake, or even on the
beach of Lake Michigan, we’ll have to do some
prowling.”</p>

<p>“I can’t say that I think it very pretty,” said
Molly.</p>

<p>“It isn’t. I’m sorry that I got you girls into
those initials.”</p>

<p>“It’s all the funnier, Jean,” said Frances.</p>

<p>“Why, I rather like it,” Leigh added.
“‘Stealthy Prowlers’ has a touch of mystery,
as my mother would say. Let’s be it, for a
while anyhow, but we’ll never tell a soul, shall
we?”</p>

<p>“After all the names that we’ve said yes or
no to, just for the fun of it, nobody would believe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">46</a></span>
that this was our real name anyhow. And
aren’t witches a sort of prowlers? Why not
prowlers with a good purpose as well as prowlers
with bad ones?”</p>

<p>“Put down Stealthy Prowlers, Nan,” said
Bess, “as our best suggestion yet, and let’s get
to talking about our attic club room. But Jean,
you and Nan have more opportunity to see
Miss Haynes than the committee does. Please
see her about the hikes. She might even know
about Scout work and be willing to camp with
us somewhere.”</p>

<p>“That’s a great suggestion, Bess!” Leigh exclaimed.
“Mother never would let me go to a
summer camp, but she might, near home, as it
would be here.”</p>

<p>S. P. ideas were growing. Jean and Nan
promised to see Miss Haynes on Monday; and
then the planning was directed to immediate affairs
with the arranging and furnishing of the
club room, the time of meetings, whether they
should have refreshments or not, and kindred
matters to be decided. Jean was to be spared
some things, for it would not be fair, the girls
said, for her to be at all the trouble, or expense,
if there were any, about the room. It was
enough for her to offer the room. But Jean informed
them that the furniture was there and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">47</a></span>
the room doing no one any good. “Mother is
having the attic all cleaned for us to-day,” she
announced, “and this morning we decided that
it was foolish to keep a lot of things that might
do somebody some good. So you ought to see
the clearance! But all the furniture that can
be fixed for us, and some trunks of things that
will be lovely for us to dress up in will still be
there.”</p>

<p>“I adore an attic!” sighed Leigh. Then a
neat maid came to the door to announce that
tea was ready, and the girls of the S. P. Club
had their first dainty meal together in their
official relation.</p>

<span>THE WITCHING WITCHES</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Phoebe</span> was delighted when Jean told her
how glad she was that Leigh was in the club.
“Do you know,” said Jean, “if it had not been
that you have liked her so much, I would not
have called her that afternoon. They seemed
like such reserved people and have so much
money and travel so much, or I suppose they
do, that I imagined Mrs. Dudley would not care
for us girls, and Leigh never seemed to. But
I understand now.”</p>

<p>“She didn’t want to show how lonesome she
was,” said <a name="Phoebe" id="Phoebe"></a><ins title="Original has 'Phobe'">Phoebe</ins>, “and then she hasn’t been
around much with other girls anyway. She was
sick and tutored, at home or wherever they
were.”</p>

<p>The whole seven, Leigh included, were going
to Jean’s after their good supper at Leigh’s.
The purpose was to inspect the attic once more.</p>

<p>“You feel better, Jean, don’t you, to have
some sort of a real name picked out, even if
it may be only temporary?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Phoebe, after what I said to Billy.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">49</a></span>
Some day perhaps I’ll tell him all about it.”</p>

<p>“None of the rest of us will, and it must be
understood that if we take in other girls they
are never to know how this started. We’ll probably
forget it anyway. It isn’t important to
the S. P.’s.”</p>

<p>The girls were delighted with the roomy attic
that was floored over the entire house. Full of
everything, it had not showed how large it was.
“Oh, Jean,” cried Fran, stooping her tall
height a little as she explored a corner near the
eaves, “the room will be the regular Witches’
Retreat, and we can have all this to fix up for
a Hallowe’en party or anything!”</p>

<p>“Yes,” eagerly seconded Leigh. “The <i>sanctum
sanctorum</i> we needn’t let anybody see, if
we want to be mysterious, but this would be
wonderful, as Fran says.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t want to wait for Hallowe’en,”
said Jean. “Let’s have an April Shower or a
May Day, before it gets too hot and ask the
Black Wizards to have a stunt.” Then Jean
gave a little squeal, for the one electric light at
the head of the stairs and another shining from
the room did not disperse all the shadows and
she had not noticed that someone else had come
upstairs. It was Judge Gordon.</p>

<p>“Oh, Daddy how you scared me!” she cried.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">50</a></span>
“Sorry, Jean. I just came up to see what
these witching witches need. I see that we must
have more lights, unless you prefer darkness
for your spells.”</p>

<p>“We wouldn’t need much more light until our
party, but if you’re having it wired it would
be good to have it when we want it, any time.
Of course we could use candles.”</p>

<p>“And burn up the place. No, I’ll have proper
lights. What else?”</p>

<p>“The running water doesn’t run and the
chimney is choked or whatever flue that is. The
stove smokes, at least, and couldn’t we have a
fireplace instead?”</p>

<p>“You don’t want much, do you?” asked the
judge, laughing. “But if you will investigate,
you will find that a little fireplace has been
boarded up. If you will be careful about fire,
I’ll have it opened up and a grate set in. The
radiator was fixed to-day.”</p>

<p>The girls found the room, or “Witches’ Cavern,”
by Molly’s suggestion, quite warm enough
for a meeting. They closed the door upon
themselves for private conference after Judge
Gordon had left them.</p>

<p>“Do you think that your father heard all we
said about witches?” asked Bess. “He called us
witching witches, which was very nice of him.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">51</a></span>
“He probably heard what we said about Hallowe’en,”
Jean replied. “Anyhow, he suggested
at noon that if the boys were Black Wizards,
we girls ought to be some sort of witches.
He had walked home with Jimmy Standish and
Jimmy told him the latest school gossip, I
guess. How about it, Nan?”</p>

<p>“Nobody knows how all these things get
around,” said Nan Standish. “But it’s a good
suggestion. Why not have Orders? The Order
of the Witch or Wings, for the bird division,
for instance.”</p>

<p>“‘Swooping Pelicans’ would be better,” said
Leigh quickly. “They look just like old witches
riding the waves in Florida!”</p>

<p>“So do the kingfishers all scrooched up on a
limb over the lake,” suggested Fran.</p>

<p>“And how about a little green heron watching
for that next fish?” queried Bess.</p>

<p>“This club’s getting altogether too smart,”
laughed Jean. “Nan, take these things down
quick before we forget ’em! Stormy Petrel is
another bird name with S. P., and haven’t we
a Phoebe bird and a Crane already?”</p>

<p>“Help, help!” cried Nan, sharpening her
pencil. “Swooping Pelican&mdash;Stormy Petrel,
any more S. P.’s?”</p>

<p>Nan scribbled away, taking notes. Nor was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">52</a></span>
she without some excellent ideas of her own.
For the next hour or so the girls made their
plans with many a laugh and chuckle. Leigh,
who always had such pretty things, said that
she could bring some cushions for the couch,
which Mrs. Gordon had already covered with
a gay couch-cover or robe. Fran had some curtains
that she would offer.</p>

<p>“Maybe you won’t like them, though,” she
added. “I bought them myself for my room
when I was about ten years old, and Mother
never would let me put them up, since my room
is at the front of the house, like this, to be
sure. Oh, I suppose they won’t do! They have
all sort of crazy things in the pattern, peacocks
and birds and I don’t know what.”</p>

<p>“Why, that would be fine for Stealthy Prowlers,
Fran,” said Jean. “Bring them over and
we can see. Mother has some plain draperies
that she is fixing. Those will show behind the
shades, but we can have our gay curtains inside
of those. We’d have to have something
to brighten things up. And I have a grand
idea&mdash;that is, if you think it’s grand, of a
witches caldron, right in the middle of the room,
with a fire under it, you know, or things fixed
to look like one, and maybe an electric bulb hidden
in it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">53</a></span>
“And let’s not have our witches all in black,
since the wizards will be, I suppose. Let’s have
yellow and black, or red and black, or&mdash;something!”</p>

<p>“Why not have each order of witches dressed
differently?” asked Molly.</p>

<p>“In other words, each girl have a separate
costume?” said Bess, in smiling reference to
their limited numbers.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” Molly replied, “but we’ll
probably have more girls in outdoor things,
won’t we?”</p>

<p>“That is to be decided,” spoke Jean quickly.
It would not do to talk of this as yet. Molly
would have everybody, dear girl that she was,
but it would not always do. “By the way, girls,
Dad said that we wanted to be careful not to
make any of the boys mad about us or get mad
ourselves&mdash;of course he did not put it that way,
but that was what he meant. He heard me gibbering
to Mother about things, you know. I’ve
had to tell her quite a lot, of course. But I told
my father that we were being ‘just wonderful’
not to get provoked at the names the boys make
up for us, and that we were planning to <em>entertain</em>
the Black Wizards, provided they would
<em>condescend</em> to an attic party. Dad just laughed
and told me that if we advertised plenty of refreshments<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">54</a></span>
he thought that the Black Wizards
would come. I said that we liked eats ourselves
and that the attic party would be a real
supper, moreover, he could come up and have
supper with us!”</p>

<p>“I think that your father is just too nice for
anything,” cried Bess, warmly. “Just think of
all the trouble and expense, too, in fixing this
up for us!”</p>

<p>“Dad likes to do things to the house, Bess.
Besides he said he hoped we’d wake this sleepy
old town up and show the folks what boys and
girls needed in this ‘day and generation.’ I
don’t imagine that he wants us to do anything
startling, though.”</p>

<p>Here there was an interruption from Nan.
“Being secretary to this club is just awful. Do
you want me to put down all your old suggestions,
or wait till we really do something?” Nan
was holding up her pencil with a comical expression
of despair.</p>

<p>“No, Nan,&mdash;you might make a few jottings
of anything you think is important, for fear the
person that makes the suggestion might forget
it. This is not a formal meeting, anyhow.”</p>

<p>So spoke the president, and Nan replied with
a twinkle, “When have we had a formal meeting?
Tell me that!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">55</a></span>
“Echo answers, ‘When’?” laughed Jean.</p>

<p>And as informally this conference went on,
among girls who were going to try something
without a real leader. As yet their plans were
unsettled, but they were evolving from chaos
quite rapidly. The world was theirs in one
sense, and girls in a small town have some advantages
over others. It is easy for them to
get together and it is only a step, figuratively
speaking, into the country, where wonderful
things happen all the time for those who have
eyes to see them.</p>

<p>At present, fixing the “club room” stood first.
Second, there was a decision to give the Attic
Party as soon as possible, by way of opening
the club room, or dedicating it. Then, meantime,
how much should they tell of what they
were doing, and how could they keep it a secret
club if they had the party?</p>

<p>The president had things to say about this.</p>

<p>“Considering the <em>way</em> this club was <em>formed</em>,
I imagine that the less <em>we say</em> right now to the
boys, about our plans, the <em>better</em>. I’d dearly
love to know what they are doing, but suppose
we let them be curious about <em>us</em>, instead of
showing too much curiosity about <em>them</em>. We
can get up enough funny things to do ourselves,
even if their doings are funnier; don’t you<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">56</a></span>
think so?” All this was in Jean’s own emphatic
manner.</p>

<p>“<em>And</em>,” she added, “the Attic Party is going
to do wonders to everybody’s disposition. Remembering
how Billy’s crowing about the Black
Wizards made me feel like getting even&mdash;in a
way, let’s remember how they’ll feel if we act
superior or anything like that. Dad is right,
and this ought to be fun, pure and simple.”</p>

<p>The other girls agreed, though Nan remarked
that she agreed “with reservations.” “If Jimmy
starts anything at home in the crowing line, I
may&mdash;,” but Nan stopped and laughed, then
asked what the girls wanted Jean and herself
to say to Miss Haynes.</p>

<p>“Maybe you’d better not suggest anything
about camping at first, girls,” Phoebe suggested.
“Just ask her if she knows what other
girls do about outdoor work and where we could
find out and what she sees on her trips, and if
we’re going to have any field trips with her,
and&mdash;” Phoebe stopped, for they all were
laughing at the long list she was making.</p>

<p>“I think that we’d better add Phoebe to the
committee,” giggled the president. “All those
in favor of adding Phoebe Wood to the committee,
say ‘ay’!”</p>

<h2><a name="vi" id="vi"></a>CHAPTER VI<br />
<span>A NEW SORT OF A PARTY</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">For</span> some days after this meeting mysterious
bundles were brought into the Gordon home.
To pass Billy, or Danny, or some of the other
boys, with a knobby package whose contents
were well kept from view by thick paper and a
well-knotted string, was such fun. Jimmy offered
to carry one for Nan one afternoon when
she was coming from Leigh’s, but Nan said that
it was “fragile” and that she could trust it to
no one. “Of course, he wanted to feel of it and
see if he could tell what it was.”</p>

<p>Whether the boys had a real club room or
not they did not know. Nor did they know how
long the Black Wizards had been in existence.
“Curiosity killed the cat,” was all that Jimmy
would say when Nan asked him where the Wizards
met, after informing him first, that the
S. P.’s were planning to have all their meetings
at Jean’s, their business meetings, at least. The
girls carefully noted all the boys that wore the
snake pin, and put their names down. This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">58</a></span>
was to make the number of girls fairly even,
when they gave their party of celebration.</p>

<p>Although there were no other children at
Judge Gordon’s beside the lively Jean herself,
the club room was kept locked and it leaked out
among the boys that the judge was having a
number of keys made, “I’d like to get into
their club room,” said Danny Pierce to Billy,
“and see what they have there. What can <em>girls</em>
do? If any of those girls lose a key, O boy!”</p>

<p>Billy Baxter took great delight in repeating
Danny’s last sentence to Jean, who passed it
on to the rest of the girls, creating quite a stir,
as Billy had intended. “Would they <em>dare</em>?”
asked Molly, in horror.</p>

<p>“No,” said Jean, “but they might climb up
and peep in. I’d better keep the curtains together,
though we’ll have to have the windows
on the balcony open part of the time.”</p>

<p>“Unless they’re human flies, they can’t climb
up,” said Leigh, looking out of the front window.</p>

<p>“There’s that oak tree,” Jean reminded her.
“Wouldn’t it be funny if they planned to do it,
and then we invited them?”</p>

<p>“Yes, but we are not sure that we’ll let any
one into the inner sanctum.”</p>

<p>Every possible moment of the week was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">59</a></span>
spent either on the attic floor itself or in sewing
draperies or annexing ornaments in the
various homes of the S. P.’s. It was not until
Friday afternoon that the committee visited
Miss Haynes, screwing up their courage to do
something that turned out very pleasantly, as
things dreaded often do.</p>

<p>The girls found Miss Haynes at the pleasant
occupation of grading test papers in her room
after school. She nodded pleasantly as they
came in, halting just inside the door, while Jean
asked, “Could we see you just a minute, Miss
Haynes?”</p>

<p>“Certainly,” she replied, “but take seats for
a few minutes. I’m just in the middle of averaging
some grades.”</p>

<p>The girls sat down at the front desks, while
Miss Haynes apparently forgot their existence
in her work. But they kept as still as mice, or
the Stealthy Prowlers they had decided to be,
though time went on and they hoped that she
really had not forgotten them.</p>

<p>“There!” she said <a name="presently" id="presently"></a><ins title="Original has 'presenly'">presently</ins>. “That’s done.
Why do we have to have tests and keep grades
anyway?”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s what <em>we</em> think, Miss Haynes.
Can’t you do something about it?”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid not, Jean,” but Miss Haynes’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">60</a></span>
eyes danced. Why, it wasn’t going to be hard
at all to talk to her. Probably it was because
she liked hiking and things that she was so
human!</p>

<p>The girls explained. They had started a club.
They wanted to do some things that girls did
in some of the organizations they’d read about
in Camp Fire and Girl Scout stories and yet
they wanted their own fun, too. They knew that
she took hikes and knew everything about nature
work and maybe camping, and could she
suggest anything that would be possible to do?</p>

<p>Miss Haynes listened thoughtfully. “Why,
yes, girls do a great deal that is very wholesome
for them these days, but if they take up
anything seriously they usually have a leader.
I am not familiar with any of the organization
work. Isn’t there any young woman in the
town who does?”</p>

<p>“Nobody, Miss Haynes, and besides, the older
girls don’t want to bother with us.”</p>

<p>“Will we have any field work in science, Miss
Haynes?” This was Phoebe.</p>

<p>“Why, yes, a little. I’m sorry that I can’t
start more, but there is a reason this year. The
schedule will not permit it, the superintendent
said, and there is some one who does not want
the children to take their Saturdays.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">61</a></span>
Jean looked at Nan. “That old school board!”
she thought.</p>

<p>“But if you want something to work toward
outdoors, I may be able to start you at something.
Bird study is my particular hobby, but
I also teach and study botany, and bugs and
butterflies and anything else in that line. How
would you like to begin on snails?” Miss
Haynes was actually pretty when she laughed
and talked like this. Nan “bet” that she
wasn’t much older than the senior girls.</p>

<p>“My father has an old zoology text with lots
of interesting pictures in it,” said Phoebe. “I’d
like snails better than snakes, but I think I like
birds best.”</p>

<p>“And you are a phoebe yourself, aren’t you?
How many girls have you in the club?”</p>

<p>“Only seven now.”</p>

<p>“Hunting birds in a crowd is not very good,
but if you will promise to be very still, and if
you really want to make a start, you may all
come out with me early to-morrow morning. I
will show you some tree sparrows, a lot of
juncos, possibly some fox sparrows, and there
is never any knowing what we may find. I’m
perfectly delighted to be in Wisconsin, for I’m
sure that birds I’ve never seen will be nesting
in this inland lake. Then I found some interesting<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">62</a></span>
specimens of other things in that
swampy place along the little run. I suppose
you girls know the common birds and you can
help me, for I have never been around the Great
Lakes much.”</p>

<p>“I wish that we could help you, Miss
Haynes,” said Jean, delighted with the sincerity
and kindness of the teacher. “We don’t
know much, only some of the commonest birds.
We know a heron from a gull and that’s about
all, I guess.”</p>

<p>“We’ll study together, then. Now I like to
stay out a good while, especially when we are
finding things, so bundle up. Any girl that isn’t
warmly enough dressed will have to go back!”
Miss Haynes smiled, but her firm tone showed
that she meant what she said, and it was not
the first time that the teachers had mentioned
the girls’ dressing too lightly.</p>

<p>“Wouldn’t it be a good idea to take a lunch,
too, in case we want to stay?”</p>

<p>“That would be lovely!” exclaimed Phoebe.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes,” said Jean, “and couldn’t we build
a fire and have something the way we do at a
beach party?”</p>

<p>“A fire would be a good idea, if it is in a safe
place, but if you are going to see birds, you
don’t want to carry much. All I have will go<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">63</a></span>
into my pocket. Have any of you field glasses,
or even opera glasses?”</p>

<p>Nobody had, so far as these girls knew. “And,
Miss Haynes, don’t you bother about any
lunch,” said Jean. “If you let us go with you,
we’ll take enough sandwiches for all of us,&mdash;please.”</p>

<p>“Very well. That is very nice of you. I am
glad that we are having this warmer spell, but
bundle up just the same, for there will be some
breeze, at least near the lake. Do you ever have
any snow in April?”</p>

<p>“Sometimes, but it usually does not stay so
long. You speak as if you didn’t want any.
Don’t you like winter fun any more?”</p>

<p>“I’m not too old yet, Phoebe,” laughed Miss
Haynes, “but I want to get out as easily as possible
during the spring migration of birds,&mdash;so
I want a pleasant April and May.”</p>

<p>“We’ll do our best to get it for you, Miss
Haynes,” declared Nan, rising with Jean, to go.
You didn’t want a teacher to get tired of you,
of course, and Miss Haynes was busy. Funny,
she didn’t like tests, either, because you had to
grade papers. Still, how would she find out who
knew anything?</p>

<p>The girls hurried home to call up the rest of
the S. P.’s and notify them of the hike. Leigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">64</a></span>
said that her father had a field glass. She would
bring that. Mrs. French hunted up an old opera
glass for Molly. Kinds of sandwiches were distributed
according to the variety each was in
the habit of making most successfully. Chocolate
bars were bought, to be stowed in pockets.</p>

<p>Without something hot it would be a funny
sort of a beach party, they thought. Accordingly
local shops sold a few tin cups or those
equally light. The girls would have cocoa.</p>

<p>In the morning, Jean, who had no glass to
carry, put her sandwiches in an aluminum kettle,
carefully wrapped “not to rattle and scare
the birds away.” Water could be found at
springs familiar to all of them. Cream went
farther than milk and was not so heavy. One
bottle was tucked in the pocket of Phoebe’s oldest
coat and Nan put another in hers. Pockets
bulged and Bess swung from her arm a box of
marshmallows, these for toasting.</p>

<p>Miss Haynes smiled broadly when the seven
girls made their appearance at the door of her
boarding house, just as she was starting out.
“Good for you,” she cried, “all with sensible
wraps on. I fancy, from the looks of your
pockets, that we shall not go hungry.”</p>

<p>Familiar as the girls thought they were with
the country about their town, Miss Haynes, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">65</a></span>
comparative stranger, could show many new
things; for some conveyance had usually taken
them to the big lake, and to the smaller ones
sometimes, for their beach parties, and many
very interesting bypaths were unknown to the
girls.</p>

<p>How wet it was. Water came up around their
overshoes as they walked over the soft turf by
the muddy road. Snow lay in the fence corners.
But the sky was blue and the birds were already
singing, some meadow larks in a field and a
flock of red-winged blackbirds in a swampy
place not far out of town. Miss Haynes called
attention to a song sparrow in a little leafless
tree, where twigs and bird were etched against
the sky. For the first time the Stealthy Prowlers
deserved their new name, as they crept near
enough to get a good look at the brown splashes
on the sparrow’s breast, with the “breast-pin”
where they coalesce. And while they watched,
the little finch bill opened and the bubbling,
merry song rang out.</p>

<p>Miss Haynes, pleased with their interest,
watched the girls more than the sparrow.
“When you learn to know voices and songs,”
said she, “you will not have to see some of them
to find out what they are.”</p>

<p>“I never thought of learning the voices of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">66</a></span>
birds,” exclaimed Phoebe, who was musically
inclined. “Has it been here all winter, or has
it just come?”</p>

<p>“It may have been here all winter, not singing
much.”</p>

<p>The sparrow had flown away before they began
to discuss it, but Miss Haynes directed
them toward some willows by the brook, which
they were approaching. “I see a little flock of
birds about those willows,” said she. “Come
quietly, and tell me what you see, after you
have had a good look. I will pass the glass
around.”</p>

<p>This time they stood at some little distance
and looked through Leigh’s glass, Molly’s opera
glass and Miss Haynes’ stronger glass. One
little fellow settled in the top of a bush, giving
the girls a fine view of his breast. No, it
wasn’t another song sparrow.</p>

<p>Another little chap turned his back upon
them; but just as the other bird flew, this one
shifted his position, and they saw that his
breast was like that of the other. Then some
movement in the bushes startled the flock. With
a soft whirring of wings, together they all flew
away and Miss Haynes turned smiling to ask,
“What did you see, girls? How many had a
good look?” she added, in teacher fashion.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">67</a></span>
“You scarcely know, I suppose, how lucky you
are to start your bird study so early, before the
foliage gets in your way and before some of the
winter visitants leave us. I’m much mistaken
if the tree sparrows will stay at this latitude,
or fox sparrows, either.”</p>

<p>“Mercy, how many sparrows are there?”
asked Jean. But not waiting to be answered
she continued enthusiastically, “Oh, I had the
<em>best</em> look, Miss Haynes! They are the cunnin’est!
I saw just a sparrowy back, something
like the English sparrows, and the top of the
head was a sort of reddish brown. Then right
in the middle of the breast there was a cute
little spot. It wasn’t streaked, like the song
sparrow.”</p>

<p>“Very good, Jean. Remember particularly
the one spot. Not all of the sparrows are so
easily identified. You asked me how many
there are,&mdash;probably you will identify a dozen
species around here, during the migration, and
there are more.”</p>

<p>“I’ll never get them,” declared Bess.</p>

<p>“One at a time,” suggested Miss Haynes, with
a smile. “Nature lessons are much like other
lessons, except that there is such a thrill to
them that you are more likely to remember
them.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">68</a></span>
“I believe it!” cried Jean.</p>

<p>“Did you hear a sweet little song, different
from that of the song sparrow, Jean?”</p>

<p>Jean and Molly had noticed it.</p>

<p>“It was from one of the tree sparrows,” explained
Miss Haynes.</p>

<p>“Did you see him do it?” asked Leigh.</p>

<p>“No; I just know the song,” Miss Haynes
returned.</p>

<p>“Imagine!”</p>

<p>Miss Haynes was already much at home in
the country about the village, and the girls, on
the other hand, were greatly surprised to find
how little they knew about some phases of their
native environment. They left the swampy
region, crossed the brook, now considerably
swollen, but having a bridge, and then left it behind
to climb a high bank or bluff, from whose
top they could see the larger stream, or river
which drained the inland lake. A few robins
were among the trees here. These the girls
knew, as well as the bluebird warble, which
called their attention to the singer.</p>

<p>A bluejay called harshly and two or three
crows flew over. Miss Haynes motioned to the
girls to stand still and listen. Dead leaves in
wet, drifted heaps, patches of snow, and leafless
trees were around them. Jean drew her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">69</a></span>
coat more tightly around her and fastened her
fur collar together. The March wind was noticeable
here.</p>

<p>Now came a funny little call, like the far away
honk of a car, Jean said afterward. Miss
Haynes’ pointing finger drew their attention to
the trunk of a large tree. Some of the girls
looked blank, but Jean had caught a glimpse of
something. Some bird had moved around, upon
the opposite side of the tree trunk.</p>

<p>There he was again! Ah, how pretty! What
could it be? A little gray-blue, or blue-gray
bird was searching the old trunk for food. He
seemed to be getting some, too.</p>

<p>Jean strained her eyes to distinguish the
markings, until Miss Haynes put her own glass
in Jean’s hands. Then, alas, she had trouble
in <a name="focussing" id="focussing"></a><ins title="Original has 'focusing'">focussing</ins> it for her eyes and the bird had
gone out upon a little limb. “If birds would
only stay put!” she thought. Now it was back
upon the trunk. Now it was going up; now it
was going down. Now it “walked out on the
under side of a large limb,” as Jean told her
father that night. Finally she had a good look,
for the little fellow stopped, raised his head and
looked off for a moment, to see if there were
any danger near, or, possibly, to find a better
feeding ground.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">70</a></span>
“Quank-quank!” he said, or “honk-honk!”
How shining a black were his crown, and nape,
and how white his breast. Never would Jean
forget her first white-breasted nuthatch. Thank
fortune, it wasn’t like anything else, either.
You wouldn’t get it mixed up!</p>

<p>By this time Miss Haynes was becoming so
interested in teaching the girls that she decided
to give up her own cherished time for discoveries
of her own in order to keep on showing
them what were, so far, perfectly familiar
to her. But her reward came a little later.</p>

<p>Again the girls became the Stealthy Prowlers
in earnest as they tried very hard to make no
noise in going down a little cleft in these high
banks. There was snow instead of mud, which
made it easier, if slippery. In a moment they
stood upon a stony ledge that was only a short
distance above a wider, sheltered spot, where
a number of birds had gathered out of the wind.
Miss Haynes’ glass was directed toward some
little birds upon the ground. Accordingly, the
girls focussed attention and the two other
glasses there.</p>

<p>Those using only eyes could see some little
brown-streaked birds, scratching like chickens
among the dead leaves. Molly grinned as she
put her opera glass into Jean’s hands and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">71</a></span>
pointed out one little bird nearest them, whose
active foot was making dirt and decaying leaves
fly behind it. “Did you ever see anything
cuter?” she whispered. “Must be some other
kind of a sparrow.”</p>

<p>By this time Jean was getting accustomed to
seeing differences. So clear was the white, so
heavy were the brown streaks of the under
parts. There was a greenish tinge to the sparrowy
crown, as the sun shone full upon it. The
long tail was a reddish brown, but it was a sparrow
tail. “It’s bigger than the tree sparrows,”
she whispered to Molly, “and look at the little
thing near him. It’s different. I’d like to look
again when you are through. If I’m not crazy,
it has a pink bill!”</p>

<p>Molly looked at both birds, changing the
focus of her glass as the birds moved a little
farther away, still feeding. “Now take it, Jean,
quick! What do you suppose that little dark
thing is? It’s got a black hood and cloak on!”</p>

<p>Jean’s hand was trembling a little as she
took again the glass offered by generous Molly.
Nothing is more thrilling than discovery. It
may not be a discovery which thrills a continent.
It may even be something that others
have discovered before. But something becomes
yours. And just that combination of circumstances<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">72</a></span>
may be new. In these years many girls
and boys are lending themselves to scientific
gains.</p>

<p>Jean was not the only girl who was afraid
that the birds would fly before they had seen
all there was to be known about them. The
glasses went from hand to hand. There was
perfect quiet till Miss Haynes herself slipped
a little on an icy stone. Another whir of wings,
and the birds were off!</p>

<p>“I’m glad that it was you, Miss Haynes, and
not us, we, I mean,” said Bess, correcting her
own error.</p>

<p>“Yes, I was the guilty one,” laughed Miss
Haynes, clutching Fran to regain her footing.</p>

<p>“Oh, Miss Haynes, what were those little
dark things, and which birds had the white
streaks in the tails when they flew? I was too
confused to tell.”</p>

<p>“You are very observant, Jean, I see. Those
were the slate-colored juncos, or black snow-birds.
They were feeding with the fox sparrows.
They have white feathers at the sides of
the tail and show them when they fly. Did
you think them pretty?”</p>

<p>“I think <em>so</em>!” cried Leigh. “Those pretty pink
bills! And they were all white underneath, so
it looked as if they had dark hoods and cloaks,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">73</a></span>
the way the dark gray went straight across the
breast!”</p>

<p>“That’s just what Molly thought,” said Jean.
“I must put down what I’ve seen for fear I’ll
get it mixed.”</p>

<p>“I’m taking notes, Jean,” said Nan. “We’ll
keep a record of what the S. P.’s see.”</p>

<p>“Then put down that the tree sparrow is
called the ‘winter chippy’ sometimes,” Miss
Haynes added. “The chipping sparrow is a
little like it, though that has no spot on its
breast.”</p>

<p>“I saw a little streak of brown on the tree
sparrow’s cheek,” meditatively remarked Jean,
to the amusement of the crowd. But Miss
Haynes told them that it was proper to speak of
“cheeks” with birds.</p>

<p>Back to the top of the bank they climbed, to
see bronzed grackles, which they knew as common
blackbirds; more bluebirds, and a small
flock of quail that scurried across an open space
into underbrush.</p>

<p>But Miss Haynes said, “Listen. There is one
more <em>very</em> common little bird that I’ll wager
half of the United States sees and does not
know. That is the tufted titmouse. I thought
I heard one. Here it comes.”</p>

<p>Something flew into a tree above their heads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">74</a></span>
and great were the twistings of necks and
pointing of glasses in the effort to see. A second
bird followed the first and there was what Jean
called “conversation.”</p>

<p>“Sounds like kissing,” said Molly, listening,
while Jean looked through her glass.</p>

<p>“More like chirruping to a horse,” declared
Phoebe.</p>

<p>In a moment a clear, sweet whistle came from
above their heads. “Spring is here now,” said
Miss Haynes. “The tufted titmouse has given
us his word.”</p>

<p>“Was that it, that ‘Peter, Peter, Peter’?”
Fran asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. And you may have noticed that the
whistle was a little like the quality of the chickadee’s
whistle.”</p>

<p>“Why, doesn’t the chickadee call ‘Chickadee,
dee, dee, dee, dee’?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and the titmouse talks in about the
same ‘tone of voice’; but I mean the clear
whistle of both of them. That will be one thing
for you to find out, then. The chickadee is the
black-capped titmouse, so you see they are related.
Who saw what the titmouse looks like?”</p>

<p>Several hands were raised, much as in school,
but no one could say much more than it was a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">75</a></span>
little grayish bird with a tuft on its head. “Look
it up in the bird book,” said Miss Haynes.</p>

<p>“Oh, we haven’t any bird books, Miss
Haynes!”</p>

<p>“That’s so, you haven’t, and not a library in
the whole town except the school library, and
that is limited! Well, there is one encyclopedia,
also a dictionary! I tell you what I’ll do. I
will bring my Chapman’s Handbook and some
field books I have to school; and if you will be
careful of my books, I’ll let you look up any
bird you like. Take careful notes of every
point when you are out. Then look it up. I
will show you how different the bills are and
how you should look for size and shape and
flight and coloring and everything. Oh, what
is that, girls?”</p>

<p>This time it was Miss Haynes who asked the
question. They were approaching the inland
lake that lay ahead of them, its quiet waters
only ruffled a little by the wind now, and its
whole expanse shining in the morning sun.
Reeds at the end nearest them grew up in shallow
sands, and there it was that Miss Haynes
had caught a glint of yellow.</p>

<p>“Where, Miss Haynes?” asked Jean.</p>

<p>“I caught a gleam of yellow; but those were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">76</a></span>
blackbirds, weren’t they, that disappeared into
that copse?”</p>

<p>“I did not notice, because blackbirds are so
common; but we have yellow-headed blackbirds
here and I imagine that is what you saw.”</p>

<p>“Jean, that was it! Why, do you know I
never saw one before, and to think I did not
find them last week! Now find me a new water-bird,
and the S. P.’s may study birds with me
forever!”</p>

<p>At that the S. P.’s began to look about in
earnest. “We have black terns that nest here,”
said Leigh. “Father knows them.”</p>

<p>As if in response to their eager desire, that
of pleasing their new friend, two birds flew out
of the reeds and settled upon the narrow beach.
“Oh,” gasped Miss Haynes, forgetting girls
and everything as she stood with her glass at
her eyes. The girls stood stock still, not caring
to look for themselves, for these were birds that
circled about the lake all summer, birds in every
variety of plumage, adult or immature.</p>

<p>But one of these two terns was the adult male
bird, with its black head, neck, breast and underbody.
The other bird was still in winter
plumage, or was immature. “I don’t know
whether that bird ought to be black at this time
or not,” breathed Miss Haynes to herself, “but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">77</a></span>
it is. Put down in your notes, Nan, that the
S. P.’s have shown their teacher two new birds
this day! Now let us have lunch.”</p>

<p>Enough material was found that would burn,
especially as Jean’s kettle contained some
kindling and paper below her sandwiches. Let
the Indians make fires without matches. The
S. P.’s would do it in the quickest way possible.
There was not much danger that they would
set fire to anything so damp as the surrounding
woods, but they were careful, for the wind had
dried the leaves in some places. It was a mild
breeze now and the sun was warm. They
screened their fire from the wind by dragging
a log around and putting some branches up
against it, or behind it in the sand. “We’ve
had a fire here before,” the girls said, by way
of explaining how they could so easily find two
posts, so to speak, that supported a third long
piece from which Jean’s kettle could hang. It
was a little insecure, but Jean watched it, ready
to catch the kettle’s looping handle upon a long
stick which she held.</p>

<p>“The boys usually drive down the supports
for us,” said Bess, “but we have to learn to be
independent now. We’ll take you to a beach
party on Lake Michigan some time, Miss
Haynes, if you will go. We’ll get some wild<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">78</a></span>
place where the gulls are likely to be, if you
like.”</p>

<p>“I shall like very much, Bess, and I will go
with pleasure.”</p>

<p>The fire was allowed to die down as soon as
the cocoa had come to the proper stage. Water
from the spring was poured upon it, for they
wanted to leave as soon as the lunch was eaten.
Along the old log they sat to eat their sandwiches
and fruit and drink their warming
cocoa, though the sun shone down upon their
backs and kept them from being chilled.</p>

<p>Nan drew from her pocket the notes which
she had scribbled on the way. “Tree sparrow,
fox sparrow, junco, song sparrow, robin,
bronzed grackle, white-breasted nuthatch,
tufted titmouse, meadow lark, red-winged blackbird,
chickadee, turtle dove,&mdash;I guess that’s all.”
But on the way back they added more, though
only recording those that the S. P.’s had actually
identified, or had thoroughly noted themselves.</p>

<p>Where two sloppy roads met, on the way
from the lake, several of the Black Wizards
came along, just ahead of the girls, to enter the
main road from the one at an angle to that
taken by the S. P.’s. “I wonder where the boys
have been,” said Jean to Nan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">79</a></span>
“I wonder what those girls have been doing
with Miss Haynes,” said Billy Baxter to his
companion. “That’s all the S. P.’s are, a nature
club! Seeking, searching, strolling, I’ve
got it, the Strolling Pilgrims. Wait till I write
that on the blackboard Monday morning!”</p>

<h2><a name="vii" id="vii"></a>CHAPTER VII<br />
<span>THE BLACK WIZARDS’ DILEMMA</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">How</span> the girls worked that next week! Mere
incidentals like lessons would come in to detain
them, or hinder them from spending every minute
on that precious new “club room,” the Attic
Marvel of the Ages, as Judge Gordon called it.
“Grecian architecture has had a remarkable
reputation, Jean,” said he, and then it dawned
upon Jean, who was having history, that Attic
with a capital letter meant pertaining to Athens
or Attica, or something Grecian. “Oh, you
crazy Daddy!” she exclaimed. But to the girls
she chuckled over their “Greek art,” as they
put up the curtains with the peacock and birds
of paradise and twining vines with flowers.</p>

<p>One of the pieces of furniture “rescued from
oblivion” was a small bookcase. That they set
up in the <em>sanctum sanctorum</em> and began to fill.
Molly brought the tree book and a big botany
text of her father’s. Jean put in the zoology
text and an old copy of Hooker’s <a name="Natural" id="Natural"></a><ins title="Original does not have italics"><cite>Natural History</cite></ins>.
Fran’s aunt, who was visiting for a few<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">81</a></span>
days, promised to send her a field book of wild
flowers. Leigh brought over a book on butterflies
and said that her father had promised to
duplicate for her whatever Miss Haynes had
for birds. “He’s going to write to a big book
firm in the East, too, and find out <i>everything
there is</i>!” she announced. “My birthday comes
in May, and if I want to, I can have books for
the club.”</p>

<p>The Witches’ Caldron would not go so well
in the middle of the room because of the electric
bulb attachment. It was given a decorated
corner, with draperies attached above in such
a way that the caldron could be concealed when
desired. It was an immense iron kettle, used
in days far back for making soft soap, an article
of manufacture of which none of these
girls had ever heard. But the kettle had belonged
to Mrs. Gordon’s family heirlooms and
had been brought by her from their former
home to this one. Both Judge and Mrs. Gordon
were of families in these regions.</p>

<p>There was an animated discussion about
whether they should call themselves witches, or
sibyls, when in the performance of initiations
and the like. “Sibyl” was more classic. The
name, moreover, began with S. But <em>did</em> Sibyls
ever have kettles? The judge gave it as his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">82</a></span>
opinion, based on a Latin classic, that they
had caves, though he said that the kettle and its
contents might be symbolic of the bubblings of
the subterranean and volcanic lavas. S. P.
might be the Sibyl’s Portent, the Sibyl’s Pit or
the Sibyl’s Potion.</p>

<p>“Thanks for the suggestions, Daddy,” said
Jean demurely, “but we are not announcing our
name as yet.”</p>

<p>The spinning wheel and a few other antiquated
interesting relics were left as decorative
to the wider expanse of attic outside of the
room, but the room itself was made cozy. The
old grate that belonged in the small fireplace
was found among the rest of what the judge
called “junk.” Several very good chairs were
mended and placed in the sanctum, along with
an old-fashioned kettle, which needed only a
little soap and water first, then some gay paint,
to make it suitable.</p>

<p>Fran had found in her attic an immense majolica
jar in bright colors. This she had brought
over in her brother’s Ford coupe, although she
had been asked what she was going to do “with
that hideous thing.”</p>

<p>“Never you mind,” Fran replied, as she did
it up in thick paper, that the world might not
“gaze thereon,” she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">83</a></span>
The girls, who were working busily, greeted
it with shouts. “A prize, Fran,&mdash;where did you
get it?”</p>

<p>“It was some present, girls, years ago, I believe.
Mother gave it to me gladly; but won’t
it be just the thing for the Sibyl to drop her
wise sayings into? We might touch up the colors
a little, or subdue them, just as you like,
and with a little drapery it should stand near
the kettle, perhaps.”</p>

<p>“These artistic ideas grow upon us,” laughed
Bess. “Would your mother feel very bad if it
were broken?”</p>

<p>“She’d scarcely shed tears of anguish, Bess.”</p>

<p>What with the different ideas, Orders of
Witches, or Sibyls, and the restraint of various
limiting circumstances, the girls were a little
confused sometimes, but they kept steadily at
one purpose, that of making a bright club room
for the present and laying quiet plans for a
summer of camping together. That idea grew
from the first. They talked it over with Miss
Haynes, who was pledged to secrecy. She
thought that she would not be able to go with
them, but the matter was left open. There was
too much of school left before them to make
final decisions or call the parents into conference.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">84</a></span>
Miss Haynes, however, gave the girls the
benefit of her books as reference. They took
the list of them. Each was going to persuade
a parent to buy her one of those they needed at
once. For the rest they would earn money in
some way. It was not long, then, before upon
a little cherry table, whose age and associations
the girls scarcely appreciated, the Chapman
<cite>Handbook of Birds</cite>, the Reed field books and the
first magazines of <cite>Bird Lore</cite> had a prominent
place. Judge Gordon said that as soon as he
recovered from the expenses of having a club
room in his house, he might be induced to help
out with the S. P. library, and Jean told him
that he was a funny daddy but nice.</p>

<p>But science was not the only interest. The
Orders of Sibyls were duly started, as soon as
the girls decided between sibyls and witches.
As Billy one day enlarged upon the fun the
boys had in initiations, and Jean duly repeated
all he said, S. P. initiations began. These, after
the manner of initiations, were entirely secret,
though Judge and Mrs. Gordon often smiled at
the squeals of surprised victims, or giggles of
the other girls. Not even the president was exempt
from initiation, but the girls promised to
do things that were “really smart,” not silly
tricks to hurt the girls. Nan and Jean were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">85</a></span>
especially good at thinking up impressive ceremonies,
with the Sibyls attired in mysterious
robes, and Molly, as a minister’s daughter, was
acquainted with so many different ways to entertain
that the girls said they had only to ask
Molly when they wanted a new “stunt.”</p>

<p>Mrs. Dudley sent over by Leigh a fine copy of
Michael Angelo’s Cumaean Sibyl, which they
hung in a place of honor upon the club room
wall, and Jean hoped that some day she, too,
might see the strange Last Judgment and the
wonderful figures of prophets and other conceptions
of the great artist and sculptor. Leigh
was very simple about her advantages and did
not seem to feel any superiority, as a girl of
less character might have done, because she had
seen the original paintings upon wall and ceiling.
They made Leigh head of the department
of travel and art, though she said that she
really didn’t know anything about either. “I
just saw what Mother and Father did,” said
she, “and some of it I remember, and lots of it
I don’t!”</p>

<p>Time went very rapidly until Jean said that
they must get at their Attic Celebration if they
were going to have any. Initiations took several
lively meetings. Occasionally they had
merely a fudge party in the club room, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">86</a></span>
ideas gave out, or they were tired of decorating
and making posters to put up around the attic.
As the migration of birds grew more interesting
in April, they not only went with Miss
Haynes, but had their own private hikes after
school, or early in the mornings on Saturday,
submitting their lists or their descriptions to
her when she was not too busy. Sometimes she
was able to take out her science classes, when
they looked not only for birds but for everything
else in Nature’s great laboratory.</p>

<p>The earliest flowers had been found. Trees
were being listed and their leaves, coming out,
noted. Even the frogs were not altogether left
in peace, and the Wisconsin pools were investigated.
The girls often met the Black Wizards
upon their hikes, but that was to be expected,
for boys always “tramp around and see things,”
as Jean Gordon said. “I don’t believe there’s
going to be so much crocheting and embroidering
or fussing with clothes in our crowd after
this, Mother,” said she.</p>

<p>“It is just as well,” Mrs. Gordon replied,
“though you must not forget to learn the gentle
art of needlework, and I should think that with
your beach parties and hikes you might want to
learn cooking as well.”</p>

<p>“I believe that’s an idea, Mother!” cried<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">87</a></span>
Jean. “Suppose you teach me first of all the
good things to stew, ’cause we can cook things
in kettles already. Maybe there is some book
on outdoor cooking, or something we can read
up on c&mdash;well, I think it’s a good idea anyway,”
Jean finished, rather lamely. She was
not ready to broach the subject of camping as
yet.</p>

<p>At last they were ready “to-start-to-commence-to-begin,”
Bess said, on the invitations.
The S. P. with its interests and a few purposes
was fully established. The attic was as complete
as any place ever is that belongs to girls
full of new ideas from time to time. Molly and
Phoebe were the artists that made, or at least
planned, the posters, as they called the decorative
pictures that they made and placed in
“strategic positions, whatever that was,” Fran
giggled, as she put up a large pasteboard supported
picture which expressed Phoebe’s idea
of “A Black Wizard Calling Up The Spirit Of
Magic.”</p>

<p>The Black Wizard was a tall, lank figure
dressed in flowing black robes and wearing a
pointed black hat. He was waving a rather
wobbly stick over a smoking fire, out of which
rose a spectral shape with a hideous face. A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">88</a></span>
snake coiled about the fire, and another lay at
the feet of the wizard.</p>

<p>“That’s supposed to be the smoke taking
shape into the figure of magic, girls,” Phoebe
explained. “That’s why you can see the tree
through it.”</p>

<p>“Oh, you’re supposed to see through spirits,
aren’t you?” Nan suggested. “It’s very good,
Phoebe. You’ll make an artist yet. I don’t
think that the Black Wizards will mind being
put in a picture, but we can’t help it if they do.
They’ve made too much fun of us. Did you
see Georgie Atkins writing ‘Stuffed Pigs’ on
the board the other day?”</p>

<p>“That disagreeable little freshman?”</p>

<p>“Yes. But Danny Pierce saw him and made
him rub it out and took the eraser and rubbed
it over his head till I know his hair was just
full of chalk dust.”</p>

<p>“The Black Wizards aren’t so bad,” laughed
Jean. “They tease us themselves, but some of
the boys won’t stand for its going too far. Well,
what do you think? Are there enough posters
done and can we get out our invitations right
off?”</p>

<p>The decision was that it could be done.
Phoebe and Molly made the designs and the
other girls drew and painted till their fingers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">89</a></span>
ached, they declared. It was no ordinary affair.
There were to be place cards, on which a mysterious
Sibyl presided over a steaming kettle,
while a large frog gaped widely at one side and
a black cat arched a bristling back opposite.</p>

<p>Sometimes it is more fun to get ready for
something than to take part in the actual performance.
But the S. P.’s knew that the Attic
Party would be a success. It was different
from what there had been before. They knew
that both boys and girls would be curious about
their club room. With a few games and good
things to eat, everybody would enjoy it, they
felt pretty sure.</p>

<p>Whom to invite was a problem. The whole
high school was not very large, but they had
school and class parties sometimes. “Shall we
just invite the Black Wizards and let them
bring the girls they want?” asked Fran.</p>

<p>“Some of them might not want to bring any,”
suggested Molly.</p>

<p>“We might not get all the girls we want
here,” said Jean.</p>

<p>“I believe that it is better to invite the girls
ourselves, and let the boys take them home if
they like,” asserted Bess. “Let’s just have
plain, written invitations, since we’re tired of
drawing place cards and making pictures, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">90</a></span>
send them to each one, with a special letter to
the Black Wizards asking them to have a
stunt.”</p>

<p>Upon this suggestion the S. P.’s acted. The
number and list of guests came next in order.
There were only fifteen in the senior class. Of
these, four were Black Wizards. It was easy
enough to choose four of the senior girls who
would be acceptable to these senior boys. “Will
the seniors want to come?” asked Leigh, who
did not know many of them very well.</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, I think so, since it is a different
party and a compliment to the Black Wizards,
in a way,” Jean answered. “If they will not
come, it is all right.”</p>

<p>“Jimmy will want to bring Clare,” said Nan.
“He’s in that state when he welcomes any
chance to take her anywhere! And here is a
place where he can sit by her at a good supper
and not have to pay for the eats.”</p>

<p>“Nan! Well, we want Jimmy and Clare for
any reason,” declared Jean, “and Bob Metcalf
will bring Lucille Arneson, I’m sure. She’s a
peach and sweet to us younger girls. I don’t
wonder Bob likes her. Now there are six junior
Wizards. Whom shall we have for them?”</p>

<p>“Wait, Jean. I haven’t got anybody down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">91</a></span>
except those four seniors. We have to have
four more.”</p>

<p>The other four seniors were listed, two senior
girls acceptable to the S. P.’s selected. The
six junior Black Wizards were discussed and
several junior girls added to the list. There
was more discussion about the sophomores,
their own class friends. Six sophomore boys
completed the number of sixteen Black Wizards,
but the whole class numbered twenty-five.
What should be done?</p>

<p>“I suggest that we invite all these girls that
we want, and if there are more girls than boys
it won’t make much difference, for Nan and I
at least will have to wait on table, and Molly
would help us, I thought. We can have a
woman in the kitchen to help, Mother says, but
we haven’t any money to have waiters, you
know.”</p>

<p>“I think it will be just the thing to have all
of us S. P.’s in our costumes, you know, and
waiting on the table and managing everything;
indeed, Jean, I don’t see how it could go off
well without it, though you ought to sit at the
head of the table, starting it off as president.”</p>

<p>But Jean shook her head. “I think we might
have some place fixed for us, a little table, or
something, because we want to enjoy the good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">92</a></span>
supper, too. But if you girls are willing to be
‘extras,’ it will give us a chance to have more
sophomore girls. The other boys might feel
funny to be with so many Black Wizards,&mdash;don’t
you think, and couldn’t we have a sophomore
party up here soon, to make everybody
feel all right?”</p>

<p>The girls thought that fitting, for there were
boys outside of the Black Wizards whom they
liked. They sighed with relief when their list
was completed. Eight seniors, twelve juniors
and twelve sophomores would be seated at a
long table which should run the “length of the
house, almost,” where the third floor roof was
highest in the center. “Sixteen on each side,
girls, and two places on each end for Fran,
Bess, Leigh and Phoebe,&mdash;to keep order,” announced
Jean. “You see, after the whole meal
is ready to serve, it will only take Molly, Nan
and me to do all the waiting necessary.”</p>

<p>“All right,” said Fran. “We’ll all help prepare
the tables beforehand, of course.”</p>

<p>“I’ll get Jimmy to help fix the long table, if
there’s no objection,” said Jean.</p>

<p>“No objection whatever,” said several of the
girls. “Who cares?” asked Fran. “Pledge
Billy to secrecy about anything he sees and get
him to come over to help you, Jean, if you need<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">93</a></span>
him. He’d like the fun, and we’ll not put up
our posters anyway until afternoon.”</p>

<p>No hint of the great celebration had been
given, for the girls were pledged to silence.
With the exception of Mrs. Gordon not even the
parents knew that the girls were planning anything
except the completion of their “club
room.” In consequence, a number of girls were
happily surprised by neat invitations to an
Attic Party at the home of Jean Gordon.</p>

<p>Written by seven different girls, the invitations
were not exactly alike, but if Leigh’s was
a model of composition and Phoebe’s a wild
scribble, as she claimed, they all presented the
same facts. It was on Saturday at six o’clock
at the home of Jean Gordon that the pleasure
of Miss So-and-So’s society was requested by
the S. P. Club for an Attic Party. Costumes
were also suggested, though that was not required.</p>

<p>With the one invitation to the Black Wizards
they took great pains. A small copy of the
Black Wizard poster was made into a cover for
the invitation. The request that the Wizards
offer a “stunt” for the occasion was put as attractively
as possible. It was a large square
envelope in which Jean handed this invitation
to Billy Baxter, with the explanation that the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">94</a></span>
other invitations were being sent through the
mail, but that he was entrusted with the care of
this one, to be put into the hands of their president
or High Wizard or whatever they had.</p>

<p>“Here is the list of girls we have invited,
Billy, and if there is any one that any of the
Black Wizards want asked, it will not be too
late, if you let me know to-morrow morning.
We do want you to do something after dinner,
as Leigh calls it. <em>We</em> have supper at our house.
But we are going to have a real chicken dinner,
though, and we hope that the boys will like it.”</p>

<p>“<em>Sure</em> we’ll like it,” said Billy, turning over
the invitation in his hands. “I don’t know what
they’ll think about the stunt, though, especially
the senior boys.”</p>

<p>“Let them out of it, then, and you juniors and
sophomores do it. Now, tell me sure, Billy, if
I have the list of boys all right. I thought that
there might be some that did not wear the pin
and we haven’t heard about. They’re all invited,
of course, but we have to fix places at
the table.”</p>

<p>Jean showed Billy the list, which was complete,
to her relief. “Are you actually going
to have a party in an attic, Jean? I thought
you had only one big room up there.”</p>

<p>“We have one big room finished in front, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">95</a></span>
the whole attic is floored and runs all over the
house, so we are going to have one big table
and I wish that you would help Jimmy Standish
fix it for us, the way they do at the church
suppers. Molly said she thought we could borrow
the tables they have at their church, if we
were careful.”</p>

<p>“Sure we can. I’ll get the truck from the
store and Jimmy and I can bring them over and
fix them for you. How many will you need?”</p>

<p>“Oh, just two or three, maybe only one.
Come over after school and I’ll take you up
there. Molly and Nan and I are going to be
there and Jimmy will probably be over, too.
But be sure to tell the boys that we’re sending
out the invitations early so they’ll have
time to think up whatever stunt they want to.
We hope that it will be a funny real Black Wizard
one.”</p>

<p>“Our stuff is all secret, Jean.”</p>

<p>“Of course, but couldn’t you think up something
on the same order, only not just what you
do?”</p>

<p>“Perhaps.”</p>

<p>And this was what caused the dilemma of the
Black Wizards. What in the world did those
girls want a stunt for? Jimmy and Bob were
disgusted. “We might know that if we helped<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">96</a></span>
those kids start up that old lodge of ours we’d
get into a lot of nonsense!” said Bob.</p>

<p>“Yep,” said Jimmy, pushing his long legs under
the table in his room. “But the girls are
getting up a big supper. I guess we can stand
it for once. The boys are dying to show off
their new costumes. Let’s take the ban off that
part of their secret stuff and let them do something.”</p>

<p>“But what?”</p>

<p>“Make them think up what,” said Jimmy,
after the cruel manner of seniors. “Aren’t you
the Grand Wizard? Can’t you eat chicken pie
and mashed potatoes and gravy and about six
different kinds of jelly or sauce and I don’t
know what all? I heard Nan discussing the
menu with Mother.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” grinned Bob, “I think I might stow
away some of that along with any junior or
sophomore. All right. I’ll put it up to the kids
and tell them they can’t make it too silly.”</p>

<h2><a name="viii" id="viii"></a>CHAPTER VIII<br />
<span>THE ATTIC PARTY</span></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Nan</span>,” said Jean, on Saturday morning,
when she and Nan were the first arrivals in the
attic with a load of articles for setting the
tables. “Nan, don’t you remember how Jimmy
used to be very mysterious about some meeting
of the boys? What if they had this society
then,&mdash;the boys about his age? You and I
weren’t much interested in those days. How
long ago was it?”</p>

<p>Nan laughed. “You must be a mind reader,
Jean. Do you know I came across an old text
of Jimmy’s last night. I was hunting a book
I wanted out of a lot put away in a closet, and
off the shelf fell this book, half open on the
floor. I picked it up and straightened out a few
pages to put it back, and there was a funny picture
on one of the blank pages, or supposed to
be blank, and a list of boys’ names. ‘Grand
Wizard, Jimmy Standish,’ led the list and I
shut up the book in a minute. It did not seem
exactly honorable to look further, though why<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">98</a></span>
Jimmy left it all in his old book I don’t know,
if he cared anything about keeping it a secret.
I was going to tell you about it but forgot it till
you spoke just now. That was when he first
went into high school, four years ago, and at
the beginning of the year.”</p>

<p>“Boys can keep a secret, then, if we can’t,”
said Jean, with a wide grin. “But I think it’s
largely because we have different ideas about
such things!”</p>

<p>“Oh, of course, Jean,” assented Nan, matching
Jean’s grin. “Never acknowledge any
superiority on their part; besides, we can keep
still about something real important, like somebody
else’s secret, or keeping quiet as we have
this time till we get ready to be public.”</p>

<p>“Do you think that we’ll get through with
everything by six o’clock, Nan?” asked Jean,
changing the subject suddenly. The urge of
imminent events was upon Jean’s shoulders as
hostess and president.</p>

<p>“Of course we shall. Don’t worry. Your
mother said that she would direct the woman
and see that everything to eat was all right and
ready on time. That’s off our hands. Our job
of scrubbing was a good one. It looks as neat
as a pin everywhere, though I think we’d better
dust thoroughly before we set the tables.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">99</a></span>
“Yes, and not a bit of soot will come through
since Dad had everything fixed, the chimney
pointed up and the roof all mended.”</p>

<p>In a few minutes, Leigh and Phoebe came
with baskets of extra silver and china and napkins,
for they were to use them rather than the
usual paper napkins with which they were content
at the ordinary party. Posters were now
put up. Laughter and jokes went around.
“You see, girls, we’ll have plenty of room for
the fun afterward. Just as soon as the supper
is over, we’ll clear everything away. Jimmy
and Bob and Billy will help us get the dishes
downstairs. I’ll have the baskets right under
the eaves, all covered up and we’ll stack the
soiled plates and everything in them. Jimmy
said there wouldn’t be much food left. But
we’re going to whisk everything in the candy
line over on the little table and let them nibble
through the evening.”</p>

<p>“What will you do with the long table?”</p>

<p>“Have it taken apart and carried down to the
shed right away.”</p>

<p>The S. P.’s worked busily all morning and
part of the afternoon, but by orders from mothers,
they stopped before three o’clock to go
home, rest, and dress later. By half-past five
o’clock they were all back ready to receive their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">100</a></span>
guests and wondering what those same guests
would wear. Word had gone out that it would
be a costume party, and they did hope that the
Wizards would wear their own costumes, presumably
of their “orders,” if they had any.</p>

<p>The “witching witches” looked charming,
Judge Gordon told them, in their sibyl costumes,
all yellow and brown and white, with
different badges of their mysterious orders.
They had made pointed hats of pasteboard covered
with crepe paper and ribbon, and the narrow
white and yellow ribbons that they tied in
a bow under their young chins were very fetching,
according to the judge. “If I wanted to
have my fate revealed,” said he, “I certainly
would have no one consult the oracle but one
of these charming nymphs.”</p>

<p>“We are not nymphs at all, Daddy,” Jean objected.
“We are sibyls, but not necessarily
ugly or old, and if we want to adapt history,
why not?”</p>

<p>“Why not, indeed? It is the fashion now to
write up history or biography at the author’s
pleasure and I doubt if some of the actors in
the tales that are told would recognize themselves.
I’m sure that you are a great improvement
on the historic sibyl.”</p>

<p>The day had not been a very pleasant one,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">101</a></span>
but the girls were thereby consoled for the fact
that they were too busy to take the usual Saturday
morning hike. A strong, cool wind blew
making Miss Haynes say that she would not
find many of the little birds flying. This was
some consolation, for the girls had been interested
in the migration of the warblers, birds
tiny and beautiful, of which they had scarcely
heard before and never seen to recognize. But
clouds cleared away in the afternoon and the
wind ceased blowing. The furnace fire that the
judge had made in the morning was allowed to
go down as the day warmed, and the attic was
made pleasant with very little heat, all its windows
open, for it was past the middle of May.</p>

<p>There were two main reasons for serving the
dinner first of all. First, it would have been
difficult to manage carrying the food to the attic
with the presence of guests there. Second,
nothing ever started up very easily before refreshments,
Jean declared, and it would be
much easier to have the stunts and games after
the meal.</p>

<p>The Wizards arrived masked, and were met
by the whole seven sibyls, unmasked. Yellow
draperies fluttered against the long black wizard
draperies or robes, as the girls flew around,
congratulating them on arriving in costume and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">102</a></span>
together, and directing where the girls that
were coming should put their light wraps and
find mirrors. Jean’s cheeks burned rosily with
excitement. It was beginning all right, at least.</p>

<p>When the last guest had arrived, Jean, Molly
and Nan slipped away, to help take up the baskets
of last things, and direct their placing.
Jimmy Standish slipped off his black robe long
enough to carry up a large kettle of hot peas,
the big, flat basket with three large pans of
chicken pie, and pitchers of lemonade. Under
Mrs. Gordon’s capable management, nothing
was omitted. A table in the corner was ready
for the hot food.</p>

<p>Then Leigh gave the word that each Wizard
was to take his lady and proceed to the attic.
“You will meet your hostess at the top of the
stairs,” she said, “and you will find your place
cards at the table.”</p>

<p>Exclamations of pleasure were heard by the
happy sibyls as the procession reached the attic
and Jean waved them in the direction of the
long table.</p>

<p>“Gee, Jean, this is some attic!” said a Wizard.</p>

<p>“Why, who ever heard of an attic like this?”
cried a senior girl. “You have electric lights
and rugs on the floor and&mdash;everything!”</p>

<p>It was a pretty scene. Judge Gordon had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">103</a></span>
consented to having candles on the table. These
were yellow and white, a little brown supplied
here and there by a narrow crepe paper ribbon,
among the table decorations. Yellow and
white flowers were not hard to find, for syringa
and white peonies happened to be in blossom
and Leigh’s mother had some creamy roses in
her greenhouse.</p>

<p>The rugs were a temporary loan, except those
in the inner sanctum, and had been gathered
up from the various S. P. homes. Interesting
decorations in different corners and the large
posters caught the young eyes at once, but they
did not need much urging to find their place
cards at once, as Jean said that the “picture gallery
would be on display after supper.” The
electric bulbs were covered with yellow shades,
but only two of them were turned on, as it was
more “intriguing,” Leigh said, to have the chief
light come from the candles.</p>

<p>The long tables were covered with white
linen. The fruit mixture known as fruit cocktail
was already at the places, also the salad,
and plates of rolls, jellies, honey, pickles and
olives, were properly arranged, to avoid much
serving. As soon as the fruit was eaten, the
girls removed the glasses and plates and
brought the savory plates of chicken pie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">104</a></span>
mashed potatoes and gravy, and peas in little
crinkled patties. Mrs. Gordon served the
chicken pie and Molly filled the patties with
peas, either of them putting on the potato and
gravy, while Jean and Nan hurried the plates
to the table in record time. Then Mrs. Gordon
escaped to the regions below, where a genial
judge would be more genial when he had his
supper. The waitresses, too, sat down to enjoy
themselves, for Jean would need only to replenish
the fresh rolls from the covered pans on the
side table, or hop up to serve a second platter
of chicken pie, ready to be filled and passed.
This was a supper where everything was to be
eaten up, and the Black Wizards did justice to
it. By the time they were ready for the ice-cream,
they would have done anything the
S. P.’s wanted, so far as willing spirit was concerned,
but Jimmy told Jean that he hoped
they wouldn’t be called on to perform right
after a “supper like that.”</p>

<p>“We shall dawdle over our ice-cream,” Jean
assured him, “and no guest of the S. P.’s is
going to do anything he doesn’t feel like doing.”</p>

<p>“Hurrah,” said one sophomore Wizard, but
he was silenced by a look from the Grand Wizard
which warned him that he must mind his
p’s and q’s.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">105</a></span>
Mrs. Gordon, through with her own and the
judge’s dinner, came up to help with the change
of courses, to put into the baskets the plates
brought from the tables by the girls and to
serve the ice-cream.</p>

<p>“Did you S. P.’s bake this cake?” asked
Danny Pierce, with a fork neatly separating a
bit from a piece of the cake known as devil’s
food.</p>

<p>“No, we didn’t,” Jean replied, “but we’re going
to learn. That is in one of the S. P. departments,
as you might say.”</p>

<p>“Cooking?” asked Danny.</p>

<p>“Yes. But we haven’t gotten to cakes yet.”</p>

<p>“Want any orders?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes. I hadn’t thought of it, but we’re
going to make some money, or try to. How
about an order of fudge for your next meeting?”</p>

<p>“Fine&mdash;unless it’s too expensive.”</p>

<p>“The S. P.’s will be <em>very</em> fair in their charges,
especially if our parents give us the materials.
It won’t cost any more than buying stuff down
town.”</p>

<p>“You will depress trade, Jean,” said Bob
Metcalf.</p>

<p>“Not enough to hurt, Bob.” Jean assured him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">106</a></span>
with a dimple in her hot cheek. Thank fortune,
so far the party was a success.</p>

<p>After the meal, the guests were invited to inspect
the picture gallery while the tables were
cleared and removed. Jimmy, Billy, and even
the judge coming up from below, carried baskets
of dishes down to the kitchen. “If this is
going to be a permanent cafeteria,” said the
judge, “I’ll put in a lift for the girls. Who
knows? Perhaps Jean will support me in my
old age with her sky parlor.”</p>

<p>“Great scheme, Judge,” said Jimmy. “You
certainly would have customers with meals like
this.”</p>

<p>The picture gallery was examined with interest
by the Wizards and by the girls who had
been invited. There was the Wizard picture,
well labeled. Several funny incidents at school
had been recorded in art by Phoebe. The seven
sibyls had the faces of the real girls cut from
old snapshots and pasted on the figures. They
were in their yellow robes, which were carried
out in long draperies that joined yellow streamers
and whirled around their heads. “The
S. P.’s in a tornado,” suggested John Taylor,
a jolly sophomore and a friend of Billy’s.</p>

<p>But perhaps most of all they laughed at a
series of drawings in crayon by Phoebe that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">107</a></span>
illustrated the different names the S. P.’s had
been called. She had been making them along
for the fun of it without telling the girls; and
when she brought them that last afternoon of
their preparations for the Attic <a name="Party" id="Party"></a><ins title="Original has 'Pary'">Party</ins> all proceedings
were stopped for a little while the
girls laughed over them until they were breathless.
These were in outline and of cartoon
style.</p>

<p>Here were the Strolling Pilgrims with field
glasses and bulging pockets, bending forward
to look at a long-legged bird that was wildly
speeding away. Here were the Silly Peacocks
before a mirror. The Stormy Petrels hovered
above a huge wave and had human faces. The
Swooping Pelicans were witches in that they
wore peaked hats and had brooms tucked under
their wings. The Snooping Puffins, a particularly
opprobrious name, was illustrated by the
outlines of a row of puffins sitting on a rock
and looking fiercely at an angular Black Wizard
whom a wave was about to engulf. Danny
Pierce, whose brilliant mind had evolved that
name for the S. P.’s had the grace to blush
when his eye fell upon that picture. “Oh say,
Phoebe, I didn’t mean anything by that! You
know S. P. can mean almost anything.”</p>

<p>“So it can, Danny. We’ve discovered that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">108</a></span>
by this time,” replied Phoebe with a mischievous
look. “But we don’t mind. It’s been such
fun. I did a dozen of these to surprise the
girls, and when we decided to give a party I
kept them till now.”</p>

<p>“You ought to study art, Phoebe, and do a
lot with it, though how you can in this little
town, I don’t know.”</p>

<p>Phoebe looked sober for a minute. “I’m aching
to study, Danny, but I’ll just do what I
can now. My father says it’s not where you
live but what you do with it,&mdash;any little talent
that you think you have, he meant. And lots of
big people come from little towns, he says, because
we get some things here,&mdash;well, things
they study about in big books, we can just go
out and see, easy as pie.”</p>

<p>“I wish I dared tell you what the Wizards
are going to do this summer, Phoebe.”</p>

<p>“I wish I dared tell you what we girls <em>want</em>
to do. Whether we’re going to be allowed to do
it or not is another question.”</p>

<p>But Danny went on around the sides of the
attic walls, seeing the Sour Persimmons hanging
from a tree, mere faces with a round persimmon
body and a collar of the persimmon
type; the Sobbing Poetesses that wept into
large bandannas; the Starchy Pedagogues that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">109</a></span>
wore wide, stiff robes and carried diplomas under
their arms, and the Sad Prunes, seven
wrinkled faces, darkened and lying in a scoop
such as is used in groceries.</p>

<p>Flattering names like Sugar Plums, Seraphic
Peaches or Peris, and Sweet Partners, suggested
by their elders, Phoebe had omitted,
keeping only to the more ridiculous combinations
possible.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Jean, “we are going to open up
the <i xml:lang="la" lang="la">sanctum sanctorum</i>, where we have our initiations
and everything. To be sure, our secrets
are locked away, but you may see the caldron
where with incantations the sibyl,&mdash;but you will
see that I can’t explain any more, of course.
And as soon as you’ve seen the room you may
have your fortunes told by the High Sibyl.”</p>

<p>Chatting, laughing boys and girls in costumes
of all sorts, for the girls came as fairies,
Martha Washington, other historic ladies or
even gay rovers of a feminine type, all crowded
into the room when Jean threw open the door.
If some of the girls were a little envious and
wished that they, too, belonged to the S. P.’s,
they did not express those feelings and admired
the gay appointments as generously as they
could. The Wizards laughed at the peacocks
in the curtains, and tried the locked door of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">110</a></span>
the closet as if they would break it open to discover
the secrets of the S. P.’s. One of the boys
gave the knob such a pull that it came off. The
girls nearest squealed, and the Grand Wizard
said, “Look out there, no rough house!”</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Jean, as the boy
looked rather dismayed and stood with the
white knob in his hand. “It was loose anyhow.
It can be fixed.”</p>

<p>“I’ll f-fix it myself,” stammered the boy, one
of the sophomores, “if you think I can do it
without seeing what is in the closet.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see about that,” laughed Jean. “Honestly,
Carter, I don’t care one bit! Now who
wants her fortune told first?”</p>

<p>Jean had been standing before some draperies
in one corner, for she really would have felt
rather put out if any one had tried to see behind
them. Yet they concealed only a corner
fronted by a sort of mortar board partition
which the girls had fixed themselves, and a little
swinging door, cut out and held in place by
strips of muslin.</p>

<p>“This, ladies and gentlemen, is the sibyl’s
cave. Even now she is consulting Apollo&mdash;I
guess it’s Apollo&mdash;about your future. You will
find on that table some little slips. Write on
them your favorite flower, your favorite study,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">111</a></span>
your greatest ambition and the girl or boy you
like best. Your name is not necessary. Then,
when you are ready, I will hand them to the
guardian of the cave and presently you will
hear the oracle speak. Oh, yes, number your
slips, please, and remember your number, for
your own convenience, because they will be
handed in order to the Guardian, who will impart
their information to the sibyl. It wouldn’t
do you any good to hear the first fortune, you
know, if you had forgotten that you were number
one. The sibyl is very peculiar. She’s something
like that mad prophetess Jimmy was telling
us about that wrote her prophecies on
leaves and let the wind blow them every-which-way.”</p>

<p>It took a little while for the girls and boys
to think up their favorite flower, study, ambition
and friend of the other sex, and some of
the more easily embarrassed omitted the last
requirement, though Jean told them that it was
“very dangerous” to do so. There was much
chuckling and joking while all this was being
done, but Number One was ready before long.
Then Jean drew aside the two curtains that
were directly in front and disclosed a low chair,
behind which stood the “Guardian” of the cave,
her face concealed by a long veil of yellow<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">112</a></span>
cheese-cloth, the same material as that in the
girls’ costumes.</p>

<p>The swinging door, cut irregularly, and the
mortar board around it had been painted in
gray and black to represent rocks over quite a
surface not hidden by gray draperies. These
were fastened to the board, and also covered
what was really an old stove pipe, whose end
protruded, but was carefully pasted over outside,
and inside for a short distance, with more
“gray rocks,” in heavy paper.</p>

<p>“After the Guardian has retired into the cave
to carry your message to the sibyl, you will take
your turn in sitting in this chair, to listen to
your fates. Through this long tube of natural
rock the oracle will be declared!”</p>

<p>Jean did not try to keep her face straight as
she made this dignified speech, and the boys
and girls had all sorts of funny comments to
make while she handed the slips to the priestess
of the yellow veil, or motioned to them to do so.
Then she drew the curtains together again,
while the Guardian entered the cave, as she explained.</p>

<p>“These slips will be all mixed up, of course,
and the great sibyl will not know <i>who is Number
One or Number Two</i> when she receives<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">113</a></span>
these slips. I do not myself know in what
order you will be summoned.”</p>

<p>Again Jean drew aside the long curtains. A
hoarse whisper issued from the stove-pipe.
“The oracle is ready. Let Number Thirty
enter.”</p>

<p>This happened to be Jimmy, who sat in the
little chair none too comfortably, and had trouble
to draw up his knees sufficiently for them
to be concealed behind the curtains when Jean
drew them in front of him. “Say, Jean, can’t
a fellow have any air to breathe?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Plenty coming from the cave,” she replied.
“The S. P. string quartette will now render a
number while the oracle speaks these secret
fates.”</p>

<p>Attention was diverted from the oracle while
the “string” quartette was found to consist of
Bess with her ukelele, Fran with her guitar,
Phoebe with an old banjo, on which she only
pretended to play, and Nan with a comb! But
ukelele, guitar and Nan’s comb, together with
the laughter of the guests, made so much noise
that Jimmy stuck his head out from behind the
curtains. “Say, the oracle says she can’t make
me hear with all that noise.” Jimmy was evidently
enjoying himself, if he had been a little
hesitant about being the first victim.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">114</a></span>
The music grew softer immediately, but it
was impossible to curb the chatter, and, indeed,
if there were any privacy to the fortunes, some
distraction outside was necessary.</p>

<p>After the first the fortunes were rapidly told,
but in spite of the whispered messages, the boys
guessed pretty well who was the chief sibyl,
Leigh. It had to be either Leigh or Molly, for
there were Jean and the “string” quartette
right before them.</p>

<p>“She’s right in that cabinet,” said Danny,
coming out with a grin.</p>

<p>“No, she isn’t,” said Jean. “Don’t you know
that sibyls only speak from a great distance in
some shrine or other?”</p>

<p>“But you wouldn’t say that this is one, would
you, to be honest?”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not saying; only she isn’t in this
room.”</p>

<p>Leigh was enjoying herself. She had learned
to tell clever fortunes and with the concealment
her shyness disappeared. It was not necessary
for her to have the slips, prepared with such
care, for her “fortunes” had been prepared beforehand
with a good knowledge of each girl’s
and boy’s history, likes and dislikes. She was
stationed just outside the double windows, upon
the tiny balcony there. The movable front of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">115</a></span>
the “cabinet” or “cave” extended sufficiently to
allow the other end of the stove-pipe to connect
with Leigh and the balcony. Had any of the
boys gone out through the windows, they would
have seen how it was managed. But the couch
on which the players sat had been placed in
front of the windows for the occasion, and until
the time to admit the guests the door of the
<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">sanctum sanctorum</i> had been locked. Molly,
who could see each occupant of the little chair,
through a cleverly arranged peep-hole, scribbled
the name on a bit of paper and passed it
to Leigh, who read it by a flashlight. But it
was a long time before any of the boys knew
how it had been managed.</p>

<p>After all the fortunes had been told, except
those of the seven sibyls, the company was invited
out into the real attic stretches for games.
While Jean was starting these, Molly came
from the cave, locked the door on the inside
and then admitted Leigh, who had been afraid
someone would see her if she climbed through
the lighted windows. In darkness Molly received
her, and when they left the room they
locked the door behind them lest any investigator
should discover their secret.</p>

<p>There was plenty of room for the usual
games played at their parties and after two or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">116</a></span>
three, Jean, who had not forgotten the request
of the S. P.’s to the Wizards, clapped her hands
together for quiet and said with a deep bow to
Jimmy, “We have with us to-night the secret
society known as the Black Wizards and we
have hoped that they would give us something
far better than anything the S. P.’s can think
up. The Black Wizards, ladies and gentlemen!”</p>

<p>Great clapping of hands came from the ladies
of the company, but Jimmy, Grand Wizard of
Wizards, had always thought that what the
younger boys had prepared to do was “too
dumb.” He wasn’t going to have them show
themselves less smart than those cute S. P.’s.</p>

<p>“Madame president, or leader of the <i>Sibyl
Priestesses</i>,” and Jimmy emphasized that, “we
greatly regret that after all this fine entertainment
the Black Wizards cannot now respond.
In other words, kids, we haven’t our stuff with
us and can’t handle it in a strange attic! But
we hope to have a celebration some day, in our
own quarters, where we may show you what
Black Magic can do!”</p>

<p>“Wow!” said Billy, who knew that Jimmy
had made up the expression Black Magic on the
spot. But the boys were much relieved at being
let off from the stunt which they had prepared<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">117</a></span>
without any inspiration except that of
dire warnings from the seniors.</p>

<p>And all this time that boys and girls in the
little town were manufacturing mystery, less
than fifty miles away, a young girl was living
it.</p>

<span>MORE IDEAS AND A WIZARD MYSTERY</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> S. P. Attic Party was voted a success.
The girls were tired but happy over it, for their
guests had so obviously enjoyed themselves.
There were so many echoes of it that it was
hard to settle down to lessons on Monday.
Phoebe was sitting with Leigh on an iron bench
in the school grounds that afternoon, soon after
they had been dismissed, when Danny, or Dan,
as he preferred to be called, came by with Raleigh
Warner and stopped to talk.</p>

<p>“I have an idea, Phoebe, if you will believe
such a thing possible,” said Dan. “Could you
let me borrow some of the cartoons you and
Molly drew for your show Saturday?”</p>

<p>“Our show!”</p>

<p>“Well, your art gallery, then. I mean the
ones about school, that good one of the principal,
and the funny one Molly called ‘What
May Happen Soon’.”</p>

<p>“Mercy, which one was that? I’ve forgotten.”</p>

<p>“The one where Miss James is driving the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">119</a></span>
<em>ponies</em> out of the Cicero class and they’re kicking
up their heels, and some of the boys, the
riders, I suppose, are flat on the floor.”</p>

<p>“Yes, Dan, and that is a good one where Billy
is pulling his father’s Ford out of the mud-hole
where he got stuck, and the one where the
bob-sled is and Fran looking at her ruined hat.”
Raleigh was adding this.</p>

<p>“I see,” said Phoebe. “You just want to borrow
them?”</p>

<p>“That is all,&mdash;now. How soon could we find
out whether the girls will let us have them or
not?”</p>

<p>“Oh, pretty soon. I’ll call up Jean as soon
as I get home. Suppose you call me up about
supper time. I’ll know by then. Of course,
you will be careful of our masterpieces?”</p>

<p>“I’ll treat them like glass, honest. I just want
to show them to somebody now.”</p>

<p>“All right. I’m willing, if Molly is and if
Jean has no objection.”</p>

<p>As no one objected to lending pictures to the
boys, the following day saw Dan and “Rall”
conferring with Jimmy Standish, and later with
no less a person than the editor himself, in the
editorial sanctum, a very ordinary but busy
office.</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Mr. Standish, “we could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">120</a></span>
print it for you at a very moderate price, but
who will pay for the job? We are not running
on exactly a missionary basis.”</p>

<p>“No, sir. We will pay for it out of our own
pockets, unless it is more than we can handle,
and soon the subscribers will pay for it.”</p>

<p>“You are more sure of your subscribers than
we are,” said the editor, with a smile. “Let’s
see the pictures.”</p>

<p>Dan unwrapped Molly’s and Phoebe’s drawings.</p>

<p>“Clever stuff,” said the editor, with another
smile. “Yes, for a school paper such outlines
will do very well. Send the girls in to see me
some time. I can give them a hint or two. My
advice is to make your paper snappy and short.
Begin with two rather small pages or even one
sheet. If you want to enlarge it you can. Get
your stuff together and hand it to Jimmy to
make ready for you. I’m making an editor out
of Jimmy as soon as he learns a few more
things&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“About printing, and the composing room,
and reporting, and everything else,” added
Jimmy, who came in at this moment. “But Dan
has a good idea about a school paper, Dad, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">121</a></span>
I think it will go with the kids. We’ll try ’em
out on the first numbers. I’m to write the first
editorials, Dad, so if there is anything you want
to get across on school matters, let me know.”</p>

<p>“All right, Jimmy. There are a whole lot of
things I’d like to ‘get across’ in this town, boys,
but you don’t dare wake ’em up too soon when
they’re walking in their sleep.”</p>

<p>“Gee, isn’t Jimmy’s dad smart?” asked Dan,
as the boys left the office. “That was a hot one
about this town’s walking in its sleep.”</p>

<p>“We’d better keep it under <a name="our" id="our"></a><ins title="Original has 'out'">our</ins> hats, too, boy.
He said more than he meant to. Did you see
Jimmy making eyes at him?”</p>

<p>The girls, meantime, were in the dark in regard
to why the two boys wanted the drawings.
They were more concerned, however, about having
missed a day’s hiking, when they heard
what Miss Haynes had seen, in spite of the bad,
windy morning. Wednesday morning they were
to meet at four o’clock, with their breakfasts
in their pockets, and hike till schooltime. May
was going and with it the spring migration of
birds; Miss Haynes would be going away after
school closed, the first week in June, and there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">122</a></span>
would be no one to make them sure about what
they saw.</p>

<p>“Oh, but you must learn to make yourselves
sure,” she told them, when Jean said as much
to her. “You will miss some things; everybody
does; but you’ll learn twice as much on your
own initiative!”</p>

<p>This hike was to be “on their own,” then,
for even Miss Haynes could not manage a hike
before school. And curiously enough, it was because
of their early rising that the S. P.’s surprised
a venture of the Black Wizards, which it
was quite plainly to be seen that they had hoped
to keep a secret.</p>

<p>It was great fun to be starting off together
in the early morning. They would not even
make a fire for wieners or bacon. This was
strictly a cold breakfast. As they went they
munched sandwiches and tossed crumbs and
cold banana skins “to the birds,” they said.
Judge Gordon had bought Jean some glasses
as good as those of Miss Haynes and these she
shared with the rest, for who could see the
markings on a warbler or a vireo up in the high
treetops without a strong pair of lenses?</p>

<p>The bushes and trees along the river road<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">123</a></span>
seemed best for finding warblers. Accordingly
they were tramping along that road, still as
mice, behind this bush or that, moving quietly,
singly or by twos or threes, when they heard a
shout and a big truck shot by. It was loaded
with lumber and the shouting came from several
boys of the Black Wizard combination who
were either perched on the boards or sitting in
the driver’s seat in front.</p>

<p>Whether they had seen the girls or not was
a doubtful matter. Jean came out from behind
a tree against which she had been braced in trying
to look almost over her head. “Say, every
warbler will take to cover after that noise! Who
was it?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Jean! Didn’t you see them? They were
the Black Wizards on a load of lumber, and
why should they get up so early if they didn’t
want to get out of town before we should see
them?”</p>

<p>“You flatter the S. P.’s, Fran. But I shouldn’t
wonder if they are doing something.”</p>

<p>“It does look that way, Jean,” said Molly,
laughing at Jean’s blank look. “But maybe that
wasn’t their lumber.”</p>

<p>“And again, maybe it was,” remarked Bess.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">124</a></span>
“Jimmy was in bed when I left,” thoughtfully
Nan added. “And I hadn’t happened to
say anything about our trip. I forgot it at supper,
just told Mother when we were doing the
dishes and I fixed something ready to take for
my breakfast. I’ll warn Mother not to say anything,
unless she has already. I don’t believe
they saw us, and it is surely not for us to make
any comments on where they were going.”
Nan’s face wore a comically sober look.</p>

<p>“Far be it,” said Leigh. “But where could
they be taking it?”</p>

<p>“All of us have a suspicion, of course. Girls,
they could even reach Lake Michigan, unload
and be back for school!”</p>

<p>“Nonsense. Danny Pierce’s father has a farm
on our little lake. Probably Mr. Pierce wanted
Danny to bring out some lumber this morning
while he could.” So concluded Jean.</p>

<p>“Yes, but what were all those Black Wizards
doing with Danny? Danny <em>was</em> driving, but you
couldn’t get Rall out of bed with anything short
of an earthquake for any helping Danny with
a job like that!”</p>

<p>“Yes, Rall is always a late riser, I’ve heard
the boys say, poking fun at him. Maybe you’re<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">125</a></span>
right, Nan. Of course we want to go camping
so much ourselves that our first thought is&mdash;what
it is. Oh, wouldn’t it be great fun if our
folks would let us go somewhere? A tent would
be good enough for me! But it’s hopeless unless
we can get some one to chaperon us. Mother
won’t hear of anything else.”</p>

<p>“We might camp in our back yards.”</p>

<p>“Yes, we could,” said Molly, and meant it.
“But when Grace gets home, I’m going to begin
talking S. P. to her. She will be dead tired,
and perhaps the woods will look good to her.
We’ll do all the work.”</p>

<p>“Oh, Molly! They’d let us go with Grace!”</p>

<p>“I think so, Jean.”</p>

<p>“Father has a piece of woods on Lake Michigan,
or very near it,” offered Leigh. “I heard
him say that he had sold a piece of it off not
long ago. I never saw it, but it’s quite wild,
Mother said. He always meant to build two or
three cottages there, one for us, but he never
has.”</p>

<p>“I feel my brain expanding, girls,” soberly
said Jean. “Find out, if it is permissible, to
whom your father sold that land. Also please<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">126</a></span>
ask him if it has water and is free from wild
animals!”</p>

<p>Leigh laughingly said that she would make
every inquiry suggested except the last. “There
isn’t a bear left in the state except ‘way in the
north.”</p>

<p>“Who knows, girls?”</p>

<p>“Nevertheless, Jean and Leigh,” said Nan,
“I don’t believe that the boys would build on
Michigan. More likely, if they are not close,
they’ve gone on to what we call Lake Baldy because
of all the eagles around there. The boys
like that lake because there is such grand fishing
there and more room to row and get around.
I’ve heard Jimmy say so.”</p>

<p>“Time will tell who is right,” said Bess.
“Come on; the scare is over. Let’s go on to
where all those trees are with such tiny foliage.
They are just likely to be full of warblers.”</p>

<h2><a name="x" id="x"></a>CHAPTER X<br />
<span>A LONELY GIRL</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">The</span> forlorn, tumble-down place of the Kleins
was on what had once been its own private
road, the road that led into a large, well-kept
farm of thrifty German immigrants. But this
was long ago. A worthless son and a still more
worthless grandson had scattered the holdings.
The woodland and nearly all of the farm besides
had been sold off for debts and living.
All that was left numbered a few acres and
those badly kept in the intervals of Jacob
Klein’s drinking.</p>

<p>Mrs. Klein, Jacob’s wife, was almost as far
from German thrift and ideas of cleanliness as
her husband, though, if some one else did the
work, she was capable of having things done.
And it was the girl known as Greta Klein that
did them, for Greta did not even go to school.
The district was thinly populated, or had been
until people began to build cottages on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">128</a></span>
farther end of the lake. No one took an interest
in these unattractive people and though it was
quite probable that a school census had been
taken and a visitor had called, possibly more
than once, so far as Greta might have known,
no one summoned her to school, no one passed
that way to go to school, and Greta had never
seen the quite distant spot where learning was
the central idea.</p>

<p>As the speech of the family was German,
Greta spoke their poor dialect of that language,
though she had recently found an old German
Bible, of her great-grandmother’s, she supposed,
in an ancient trunk which was in the
queer little attic. But aside from this and a
few papers, the trunk was empty, for everything
which could possibly be used in the way
of clothing had long since been put into use.
But after the Bible was found, Greta’s German
improved.</p>

<p>The house consisted of a one-story cottage,
the first <a name="building" id="building"></a><ins title="Original has 'bulding'">building</ins> of the original immigrant, and
built solidly by the farmer himself. To this
two-roomed cottage an addition had once been
made, with one room on the first floor, a low
room above and a tiny attic. The addition had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">129</a></span>
never been painted. The paint upon the first
cottage had worn off with the years and the
storms until the shabby, dilapidated house
looked all of one piece with its dark, dingy exterior.</p>

<p>Birthdays were never celebrated in the Klein
family, but when Greta once asked her mother
when she was born she was told that so far as
her mother remembered it was the fifteenth of
June. This Greta did not forget, though she
never mentioned it again. For some reason
her parents did not like her, she was sure.
There was a little boy of five and a little girl
of three, for whom her mother seemed to have
some affection, but Jacob Klein paid scant attention
to any of them except to threaten and
be as abusive as a man who drinks can be. For
Greta there was only hard work with an effort
to avoid her father as far as possible. In this
her mother helped her. More than once she had
sent Greta into the woods with the younger
children and taken a severe beating herself
from the quarrelsome Jacob.</p>

<p>“I’m going to go off by myself on my birthday,”
Greta promised herself. She had never
done it before, and she was not sure just what<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">130</a></span>
would happen if she did; but she would. Probably
the campers would have come by this time
at the cottages and Mrs. Klein would get some
washing to do, or, rather, for Greta to do. But
that would not matter. She would take one
day. If she only dared walk into town! But
that was a long way off, and then her clothes
were so queer that she was ashamed to be seen.
Once in a great while Jacob Klein would take
his wife and the two younger children in the
old wagon, behind the bony horse, and drive
to the village. But since some one had asked
why he did not send Greta to school she had
never been taken, and that was as much as
three years before.</p>

<p>Unloved and unloving except for a sort of
affection for the two ill-natured children, Greta
was an unhappy child, often puzzled over many
things, odd things that had happened. For the
woods and the river and most of all the
lake that shimmered its blue in these early
summer days, Greta had a great love. There
clothes did not matter, nor whether she had
enough to eat, and with a feeling that she must
be personally clean, a feeling not shared by the
other Kleins, she had gotten into the habit of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">131</a></span>
slipping out of the house in the summer days,
before the rest had wakened, and of taking a
plunge into the often cold water of the lake.
Then, refreshed, she would return, ready for
the hard work of the day, or for the tiresome
task of looking after the children.</p>

<p>It was about four o’clock one morning when
Greta flew through the woods on the opposite
side of the road past the Klein house. Mrs.
Klein had told her that she must catch some
fish before there would be anything to eat for
breakfast. They were out of flour and there
would be no more killing of the few hens they
had, whatever Jacob had to say about it. He
could work a little.</p>

<p>Through the trees Greta darted while the
birds sang and the life of the woods stirred
about her. She carried a little bundle beside
her fishing pole and when she came to a large
willow that hung over the water, she stopped,
stepped among some screening bushes and
threw off the dingy clothes she was wearing, to
put on a queer patchwork of a bathing suit
which she had sewed together from pieces. She
did not dare to wear any of the clothes her
mother knew about, and as there was an occasional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">132</a></span>
early fisherman on the lake she must
have something in the way of a water garment.</p>

<p>But it was fun to dive from the long, heavy
limb that extended into the water. It was deep
enough for a good dive at this point, and Greta
enjoyed a short swim before she landed a little
further down, ran to the bushes and dressed
again. Then she hung her shapeless bathing
suit on a high limb, to dry, and hurried to where
an old boat was moored. In a few minutes she
was far from the shore, sending her boat to
the fishing ground where she thought she would
have the best and quickest success.</p>

<p>This took her near a point that ran out into
the lake, a low point, wooded and beautiful with
its tall trees and thick bushes. A clatter of
some sort drew her attention from her line
after a while. Looking along the shore, she
saw, in a comparatively open space a team
of horses, apparently attached to a wagon,
and a large truck backing around. The clatter,
she now saw, had been made by a pile of lumber,
thrown from the truck. More was being
put in a different spot.</p>

<p>Greta’s clear eyes needed no field glass to
determine that a number of boys were running<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">133</a></span>
about, directing, calling, looking up and down
the shore, and while she looked two of them
hugged each other and performed an impromptu
dance of exultation in an open spot.
Greta laughed in spite of her small acquaintance
with laughter. Boys, building a shack, of
course for a summer camp! Well, she would
have to keep out of sight more carefully than
ever. Greta sighed as she drew in her line and
took from it a fat lake trout. She rowed farther
away and cast again, waiting patiently and
thinking of many things. At present her ambition
was to help, either with housework or with
children at some of the summer cottages. But
when she had asked her mother if she might,
she had met with a sharp refusal, though the
money from such work would have helped at
home.</p>

<p>If she only could earn a little money with all
the hard work she had learned to do! She could
have some decent shoes, perhaps and one whole,
respectable dress!</p>

<p>One other fish, and there was enough for a
good breakfast. It was six o’clock when she
reached home, to be scolded for being so late.
Jacob Klein was still in a drunken sleep. Mrs.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">134</a></span>
Klein was just getting up and the children were
clamoring for attention. Roughly their mother
spoke to them, telling Greta to do the milking
and the feeding outside first, then to clean the
fish and get breakfast.</p>

<p>Greta had friends in the lean cow, whose
chief feed was the grass by the roadside, the
hens, a straggling lot, a few baby chicks, and a
couple of gaunt pigs in an ill-smelling sty at the
rear of the yard. Two dogs, shut in the old
barn for the night, came leaping out upon Greta
as she opened the door. She was the only one
who never kicked or abused them.</p>

<p>So Greta Klein’s day began, much better
than the winter days when there was a hunt for
fuel, chiefly taken from the woods which did not
now belong to them and where good trees would
be missed. Fishing could be done by cutting
the ice in the lake, but flour was often low and
they lived on the cheapest of food.</p>

<p>The children had milk for their breakfast.
Not until the ill-tempered man who actually
ruled this family stirred and demanded something
to eat did Greta cook the fish, dodging
a slap from the great hand, so ready with a
blow, and not daring to take a taste of the fish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">135</a></span>
which she had caught. A glass of warm milk,
taken from the pail before she brought it in,
since objection might be made later, was a satisfying
breakfast to Greta. She welcomed the
order to go down the lake to the cottages, get
the clothes from the one family who had the
courage to give their washing to Mrs. Klein,
and see what other cottages were occupied.
Greta was to ask for more work.</p>

<p>As the patched clothes Greta wore were
neither whole nor clean, Mrs. Klein brought out
Greta’s best dress, a hideous plaid gingham
with a tight waist and a full skirt, poorly
gathered on. The only reason for this was that
people would be more likely to send the washing
if the girl asking the work looked fairly
clean herself. “This ought to be washed,
Mother,” said Greta, though in German.</p>

<p>“And wear it out!” replied her mother. “Talk
your best English to them and get me two washings
if you can. It is a lucky thing that you
learned the English before you were sick.”</p>

<p>That was always a funny thing to Greta, that
in some way she had learned English before she
was sick, that sickness that was brain fever,
she was told and made her forget all about when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">136</a></span>
her little brother had been born and made her
speak German so poorly, and yet she could
speak English! She must have gone to school
some time, though her mother would give her
no satisfaction about when or where. “You
have had enough schooling,” was all that she
would say.</p>

<p>Nothing in the way of English papers or
books were ever brought into the house, yet
Greta saw both sometimes at the cottages where
she took back or gathered the clothes. Her
eyes devoured them while she waited, and if
she edged near some table she could read a few
lines. Once a woman asked her if she liked to
read, and on the girl’s reply that she did, she
handed her one of the newspapers. “We’ve
read that. It’s several days old, for we have
to get our papers by mail, but the news is fairly
late.”</p>

<p>Greta was glad to get anything to read,
whether the news was late or old. In the shelter
of the willow, before she took out the clothes
for which her mother was waiting, she read almost
every word and put the paper in her hiding
place, a hollow tree near by. But a storm
came up that very night. Her hollow tree was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">137</a></span>
felled, the paper blown out and destroyed! That
was a calamity of the preceding summer.</p>

<p>But Greta was beginning to feel that she
must rouse herself a little from the conditions
at home. Her father’s drunkenness was growing
unbearable. Always of a cruel disposition,
with a feeling that he had a right to beat his
wife or children as freely as he beat his horse,
he was often dangerous, Greta thought. How
long her mother would stand it was a question,
yet she seemed to take it as a matter of course,
though doing her share of the quarreling. The
German Bible was a help in the worst of
Greta’s troubles. Her great-grandmother must
have been a good woman. But some time she
would go away and then try to earn money to
help her mother and the children.</p>

<p>Now Greta Klein was a pretty girl. Had she
been dressed as well as Jean Gordon she might
have looked not unlike the impulsive Jean. But
her large, dark brown eyes had a sad look in
them and her face was worn; for while the hard
work she had been forced to do had given her
a certain strength, there had been enough of it
to amount to over-work, which is not good for
growing girls. Her mother said that she would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">138</a></span>
be sixteen on her next birthday and that would
be on the fifteenth, for which Greta was having
plans.</p>

<p>Again the rowboat made its way out into the
lake. Again Greta took a look at the pile of
lumber on the peninsula. Perhaps the boys
would want their clothes washed, but she would
not tell her mother about it. It would be terrible
to go there for them.</p>

<p>Greta <a name="made" id="made"></a><ins title="Original has 'may'">made</ins> her way to the cottage, where an
energetic, keen-eyed woman answered her
knocking. “After this please come to the back
door, Greta. I always have the clothes there
for you. And I see that I shall have to have
them done every week for the children get so
dirty. Please be careful with the colored clothes.
Last week that red handkerchief ran into Buddy’s
blouse and that will never do.”</p>

<p>“I will try to be careful, Mrs. Smith.”</p>

<p>Greta took the large bundle which Mrs. Smith
gave her. It was too large to carry around.
Why hadn’t she thought to go to the other
houses first? “Are there any other families
where you think Mother could get washing to
do, Mrs. Smith?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Yes. Mrs. Bliss next door wants some one.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">139</a></span>
They came day before yesterday. If you like
you may leave the clothes on the back porch
while you go to see her. I’ll keep an eye on
them, of course.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, I’ll hurry.”</p>

<p>“Poor child,” thought Mrs. Smith, “she looks
half tired to death all the time. But I couldn’t
have her coming to the front door, and I must
have my clothes done properly!”</p>

<p>Fortunately, the cottages were closely set
and along the shore. Two big bundles Greta
lugged along, knowing that her mother would
be satisfied to add another washing, and thinking
to herself that it was all she could do herself,
especially if she spent her birthday as she
intended. From her window Mrs. Smith was
watching her, again wishing that she had not
spoken so sharply. Then she had a thought.</p>

<p>“Greta! Greta Klein!” she called, just as
Greta was arranging the bundles in the boat.
Greta looked up and saw Mrs. Smith waving
at her. “Wait a minute, Greta.”</p>

<p>It was several minutes, while Greta stood at
the home-made, funny little dock that ran out
narrowly into the lake. Then Mrs. Smith came
running down to her with a bundle in her hand.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">140</a></span>
“I thought that you might like some sugar
cookies to eat on the way home. I want you to
eat them yourself, remember, and I’m going to
ask you if you did!”</p>

<p>Greta smiled and looked surprised.</p>

<p>“And here is a book that I found in the cottage.
A young cousin of mine left it here last
summer. If you can’t read it,&mdash;though you
speak such good English that I suppose you
can,&mdash;you will find some pretty pictures
through it. It’s a story of girls about your
age.”</p>

<p>“Oh, thank you, Mrs. Smith, very, very much.
I can read it and I haven’t any books of my
own! You are so kind!” Greta’s eyes were full
of tears at the unexpected warmth in Mrs.
Smith’s tones. She had not minded much being
told to go to the back door. She ought to
have thought of it herself.</p>

<p>A happier girl rowed the boat back. She had
a book of her own. She would read it on her
birthday. The only thing that troubled her
was how to keep it from being found and destroyed.
She would hide it in the barn this time,
or perhaps she could get it into the attic, where
the Bible was. They let that alone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">141</a></span>
The sugar cookies were good and with them
was an apple. The fruit on the Klein place was
very limited now. Greta thought of saving it
for her brother, but questions would be asked.
She would do what Mrs. Smith told her to do.
The book she could scarcely wait to open. Suppose
something should happen to it before she
read it! She was almost tempted to stop before
taking home the clothes; but concealing the
volume as well as she could, she lugged home
the bundles from a rude dock nearer than the
one by the willow.</p>

<p>Fortune favored her. Her mother and the
children were out in the pasture. Something
was the matter with the horse. It lay on the
ground, she saw, but she flew to the attic with
her treasure and tucked it under the ragged
quilt and old comforter that covered the cot
where she slept now. Even in the cold winter
she often came here, for she was afraid of her
father when he came home so intoxicated; and
sometimes her mother would bring the smaller
children to her there.</p>

<p>She supposed that her father had gone to see
if a veterinary surgeon, the “horse-doctor,”
would come, and with such opportunity she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">142</a></span>
hesitated about leaving the book. But no, her
mother would be angry if she did not start the
washing, late as it was. She ran down the stairs
and out into the shed for the tubs, unfortunately
colliding slightly with Jacob Klein when she
opened the shed door quickly and stepped out.</p>

<p>Out of sorts about the horse and irritated by
the sight of Greta and her little bump against
him, he roared out loudly in German, asking
her what she was doing and why she wasn’t doing
her work, enforcing his words with a blow
that sent her stumbling to the other side of the
shed, where she hit her head against the metal
tub hanging there and fell unconscious. The
man hesitated, with all his brutality, this was
the first time that Greta had not been able to
dodge a blow. He recalled his wife’s threat, a
potent one, but the girl would be up in a minute.
What was he going to do about that horse?</p>

<p>When Greta regained consciousness, she was
lying on the old cot in the front room and some
one was leaning over her. It was the horse-doctor!
“There; she’s coming around all right,
Mrs. Klein. Tell her to keep her head tied up
if she doesn’t want a scar, and give her some
more of that medicine. I’m glad Jake told me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">143</a></span>
about her before I started with nothing but
medicine for his horse. To tell the truth, Mrs.
Klein, I thought he was more anxious about the
nag than about the girl. He said that his oldest
girl ran into a tub and cut her head and fell
down in a faint. How did it happen?”</p>

<p>“I didn’t see it. She slipped and fell, Jake
said. He was in the house. I was watching the
horse.” This was all that Mrs. Klein would tell,
in her broken English, and Greta had no desire
to tell more, though she asked, “Will I have to
wash to-day?”</p>

<p>“I should say not,” said the old doctor. “Get
her to bed.” With this, the doctor picked up a
German paper that had come, as one did every
week to Jacob Klein, and prepared to remain
until that child was put to bed. Such unfeeling
parents he never saw.</p>

<p>Greta, meanwhile, thought of the book. She
did not want her mother in the attic. She sat
on the edge of the cot, dizzy and sick. But she
had often worked when she felt as much so. “I
can get upstairs alone,” she said, “I feel better
now.” And upstairs she went, though slowly,
taking the bottle of medicine and a spoon, with
a glass of water which her mother handed her.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">144</a></span>
To think of it! It was almost worth the blow to
be alone in her attic. She would feel better
after a while, and read!</p>

<p>That night there was an unusually loud quarrel
in the room below Greta’s attic. “What did
I tell you? You leave Greta alone unless you
want to go to jail. I will tell what I know!”
This was the substance of the German words
that Greta Klein heard. What had her father
done? Her mother must care a little for her or
she would not want her husband to leave her
alone. No, it was just that Greta could work!
So the woman went on to say. While he was
drinking himself to death whenever he could
get anything to drink, Greta could do the work
and earn the money by washing and ironing.
Jacob was to let Greta alone. She would manage
her. “She isn’t your child,&mdash;you are not her
father!” Greta heard, and sat up in bed to
listen.</p>

<p>But after that the voices were lowered, and
Greta heard the door of their bedroom closed
tightly. Her own door was ajar. That she rose
to close and latch as the old-fashioned fastening
would permit.</p>

<p>If what Mrs. Klein said was true, it explained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">145</a></span>
a good deal. Probably her mother had been
married before. And possibly, possibly, she was
only a step-daughter to Mrs. Klein herself.
Greta felt ashamed that she would be glad if
that were true. And oh, how good it was,&mdash;not
Jacob Klein’s daughter! Then her name would
not be Klein, even. Would she dare ask her
mother about it? Mrs. Klein was quite capable
of telling her that she had misunderstood what
was said. Where had Greta gotten these different
ideas of what was square and right to
do? All at once she knew that she was different.
But her head ached so. She had not been able
to read the story. She could think better to-morrow.</p>

<h2><a name="xi" id="xi"></a>CHAPTER XI<br />
<span>THOSE “UNINTERESTED” PARENTS</span></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Girls</span>,” said the president of the seven
sibyls impressively, “do you realize that it is
too late for us to make any money to amount
to anything this year? I mean the school
year, of course. The Black Wizards have to
make some; Billy told me, and you and I know
what for, or we haven’t had much trouble in
making a pretty good guess. One of the church
societies is selling that candy we thought we
could get hold of. Our fudge goes off like hot
cakes when we make any, but school is nearly
out and I’m proud to think that every one of
the S. P.’s gets out of finals, and that in spite of
our new club and all our doings!”</p>

<p>“We had our scholarship up all the year before,”
remarked Phoebe.</p>

<p>“Phoebe is nothing, if not frank,” laughed
Bess.</p>

<p>“Traitoress!” hissed Fran, in such good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">147</a></span>
imitation of a reading which they had recently
heard at school that they all applauded but
Phoebe, who declared that she thought the
truth might just as well be acknowledged. “I
couldn’t have brought up any low grades while
we were doing all the extra things and taking
the early hikes and all.”</p>

<p>“No, neither could I, Phoebe, you’re right,”
said Jean. “All of which goes to prove&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“‘That music is both elevating and refining’.”</p>

<p>“Stop your nonsense, Phoebe! I’m trying to
get something across.”</p>

<p>“Oh. Sorry, Madame President. The subject
was making money, I remember.”</p>

<p>“Exactly. The time has come to call on our
worthy parents with the request that they will
advance the money for a tent and let us go
camping as soon as school is out. We have
enough money in the treasury for the books we
positively have to have or think we have to
have, as my father says, so that’s all right, and
we can have a real campaign in the fall. Nan’s
father says that we ought to start one for a real
good school library, since we are interested in
books. He thinks that we could get some good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">148</a></span>
gifts from the people around town and that perhaps
we could stir the school board up to do
something, maybe get the people to vote them
more money for it, though taxes are bad enough
as it is, he says.”</p>

<p>“My father says that he will take it up in
the paper, too, girls,” Nan added, “and the few
copies of the school paper that we’ve been getting
out with the boys have gone all over town.
I’ve heard all sorts of things about the S. P.’s
and Molly’s and Phoebe’s drawings. They
think we’re ‘real cute’ so far! But let’s show
everybody we can be more than funny.”</p>

<p>“Hear, hear!”</p>

<p>The girls were not in their club room for
this called meeting. In spite of windows and
cross draughts, the fact remained that the attic
was directly under the roof. June suns often
made it quite warm. It was time to think of
camping. Just now they were all in Jean’s big
swing, three on a seat, Jean standing between
them.</p>

<p>“Molly, tell the girls what Grace wrote.”</p>

<p>Molly drew a folded paper from her notebook.
“This is a sheet from Grace’s letter,”
said she. “She wrote to all of us, and this is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">149</a></span>
what she said to me: ‘Molly, I just can’t write
you a separate letter, have scarcely a minute
free with all the last doings. I shall be a wreck,
but if you promise that you really will keep
things going at first yourselves, I’ll only be too
glad to spend a few weeks in the woods or on
the water. I told Mother that last week and
I’m surprised that you wrote me about it. Perhaps
she forgot to tell you.’ That’s all about
that.”</p>

<p>“Why, how funny!” cried Phoebe. “It’s wonderful
that Grace will do it, but why did your
mother ask her? Did you tell her how much we
wanted to go camping?”</p>

<p>“Only what we agreed, that we would talk
about girls’ camps and how much fun it must
be, and send for catalogues about tents, and
talk about raising money.” Molly laughed herself
at the array of hints which almost any
discerning parent might take.</p>

<p>“Bless you, Molly, you’re the most transparent
little dear in the world. You probably
talked in your sleep, too.”</p>

<p>“I do sometimes,” Molly acknowledged. But
for once the S. P.’s were not right. Parents
sometimes make plans for their children and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">150</a></span>
wiser ones than those same children often
make. Seven fathers were having a glorious
time in planning a little surprise, to say nothing
of as many mothers, who were using the
telephone or calling on each other occasionally
while the girls were in school. It was a generous
little plot against the S. P.’s, and for
their benefit.</p>

<p>“I asked Mother about it and she said that
she <em>had</em> written to Grace about it, since we all
were talking about what fun it would be to
camp. She thought it could be managed, if not
right away, probably soon after Grace’s Commencement
is over. She and Father are going
on to it, you know.”</p>

<p>“Then all we’ll have to do is to get everybody
else’s permission, and I’m pretty sure if Grace
is with us, and we don’t go too far away, they’ll
let us.” Jean’s voice had a happy lilt.</p>

<p>“Wait, Jean,” said Molly. “Mother told me
that Grace had already written to her about it,
but that she thought it too soon to make it definite
and there were other reasons why she had
not said anything. Grace said that one of the
senior girls had been a junior councilor at an
eastern camp for girls, that another had a troop<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">151</a></span>
of girl scouts in her home town and still another
knew all about the camp fire girls. So
Grace will know a lot of things for us to do. I
wish Grace was going to be at home next year!”</p>

<p>“Is she going to teach or something?”</p>

<p>“Worse. She’s going to be married.”</p>

<p>The Black Wizards were behaving in a most
mysterious fashion in these days. The girls
were quite sure that they had not seen them
that day upon the river road, or they would
have suspected that their secret was known or
surmised.</p>

<p>After school they would disappear with great
suddenness. On street corners or in the school
grounds they held secret confabs when they
met. Sometimes a machine would be waiting
for them after school. As boys do, they would
pile into it and drive off with more than the
usual air of a good time. Indeed, they made
an effort to repress their usual high spirits and
noise, a thing which in itself would have called
attention to them. The girls saw no more lumber
going out of town, but that was because
the early and late hikes had stopped, or possibly
because the lumber had all been delivered.
It would have been fun to find out where they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">152</a></span>
were building, but the girls were too busy with
other things. It was not directly on any of the
main roads, at least, where they drove with
their parents at odd times. Miss Haynes had
announced her plans early enough for them not
to count upon her, but they were quite content
to rest their hopes on Grace French, who was
so attractive, and engaged!</p>

<p>With much glee the girls made fudge that
evening of the called meeting, one batch after
another, more than one kettle on at a time, each
in charge of a separate S. P., since too many
cooks do often “spoil the broth.”</p>

<p>“After saying that we’ll have to give up making
money, here Jean puts us at making candy
to sell to-morrow!” whimsically Phoebe complained.</p>

<p>“We need just a little more for that set of
nature books,” said Jean. “Besides, what
cruelty not to supply those Black Wizard carpenters
with something to eat while they work!
Do you realize that to-morrow is the last day
for us, except when we go to get our grades?
Now, Molly, you can start the hard molasses
taffy. We’ve got enough fudge, after we get
that last beaten. Leigh, did you bring that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">153</a></span>
oiled paper? And oh, Nan, did you put down
how much we paid for the sugar? Mother gave
us the cream. While the last cools, we’ve got
to make the little S. P. cornucopias, if we stay
up half the night to do it! Don’t you think that
we could charge ten cents for them instead of
five?”</p>

<p>“Poor Wizards!” cried Molly.</p>

<p>“It’s not just the Wizards we sell to. Well,
all right, but don’t fill them as full as you did
last time. Our candy is just as good as what
you buy in a box, and we give more for the
money now than they do at the church sales.
Billy said so.”</p>

<p>“Jean’s getting stingy,” giggled Bess. “But
if ‘Billy said so,’ it must be all right.”</p>

<p>Jean, already flushed with the cooking and
the warm evening grew a little rosier. Billy
had managed to see a good deal of her lately,
whenever Wizard affairs permitted it. But
there wasn’t anything “silly” about it. Probably
she’d better not quote Billy any more.</p>

<p>After the noon meal the next day, the girls
took their candy to school. Half of it they sold
at once. The rest they had for sale after school,
outside of the school grounds. Six of the Wizards<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">154</a></span>
were climbing into a Ford sedan when
Molly and Jean ran with a school bag full of the
little packages. “Don’t you want something
to eat on your ride?” asked Molly of Jimmy
Standish.</p>

<p>“I believe I do,” grinned Jimmy, feeling in
his pocket. “I just bought some at noon, but
I need nourishment already.”</p>

<p>“I need all my nickels,” said Billy Baxter,
“but as you said at noon, Jean, that this is the
last chance, I’ll indulge, too. Give me two, if
you please, one fudge, the other that good hard
stuff that lasts longer.”</p>

<p>“Molly’s going to find out how to make the
kind you eat off of sticks, Billy,” said Jean, as
she picked out two of the fattest looking cornucopias
she could find and handed them to him.</p>

<p>“That cornucopia shape is the most deceiving
thing, Jean,” said Jimmy. “It’s on the
same style of having the best on top. You think
you still have a lot, and there’s only one measley
piece left.”</p>

<p>“Measley, Jimmy?” asked Jean, as Jimmy
put a piece of fudge in his mouth.</p>

<p>“I’ll take that back, Jean. It’s good, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">155</a></span>
you’re the little girls that can get money out
of a customer! So long.”</p>

<p>It was great to have the freedom instead of
taking the examinations. Their parents congratulated
them and expressed pride that they
had made high grades, but the girls were surprised
at the lack of interest they showed when
the subject of camping was definitely put before
them.</p>

<p>“Why, I can’t get Father and Mother interested
at all,” Jean complained. “I don’t know
what’s gotten into them! They haven’t any
great objections, as I thought they might have,
but I can’t get them to do anything.”</p>

<p>“Same thing at our house,” said Leigh Dudley.
“I thought that Mother, at least, would be
interested, but she asked if I thought Grace
were old enough to take care of us, and where
we thought we’d like to camp, and said that
she would think about it; but when I asked her
if we could pick out the sort of tent we wanted,
she said, ‘Well, it wouldn’t do any harm,’ even
if we didn’t go!”</p>

<p>“We ought to have begun to talk it up
earlier,” Fran declared. “But all is not lost.
We’ll just have to keep it before them, in a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">156</a></span>
nice way, of course. Teasing is N. G. at our
house.”</p>

<p>“Also at ours,” said Nan.</p>

<p>“Especially tell them how safe it will be near
home and how much better off we are than girls
who have to go a long way off from home, pay a
big railroad fare and aren’t familiar with the
country as we are here, to know about snakes
and things.”</p>

<p>“Better not mention snakes!”</p>

<p>“This sounds awful, girls, as if we were in
the habit of ‘working’ our folks!” Thus Jean.</p>

<p>“It isn’t ‘working’ them, Jean,” said Fran,
“but you do have to use some <em>tact</em> to get the
grown-ups interested. And we do want to go,
and we think it will be all right. Now if we
can only get them to thinking so, too!”</p>

<p>“All right, Fran.”</p>

<p>It may be imagined, however, how embarrassing
all this was to parents who were planning
not only to let the girls go, but to have
supplies ready by a certain time and break the
news in the way of a surprise.</p>

<p>A few ideas of the girls, however, were able
to fit in nicely toward the common goal, as
when no objection was made to “hiking suits.”<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">157</a></span>
Middies and bloomers became popular for the
summer outfit. The mothers had wondered
how the matter of clothes was to be handled, if
the girls were to be ready. Fathers soberly
commented on how sensible girls were getting
in their choice of clothes, and the girls, accustomed
to teasing remarks, thought nothing of it.</p>

<p>Meanwhile preparations went merrily on.
“It is scarcely more expensive than sending our
girls on some trip,” said Mr. Standish one early
June evening, as he drove with Mr. French,
coming into town along the river road. “I think
that they will be enthusiastic over it, though
you can not always tell about young folks.”</p>

<p>“I can not imagine their not being happy over
it, Standish.”</p>

<span>THE “GRAND” SURPRISE</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">No</span> one felt like working while waiting for the
final day of receiving grade cards. Senior affairs
and Jimmy’s graduation concerned Nan
and the Standish household, though Jimmy
seemed to have little concern about it. But
then, Jimmy wasn’t a girl, with gowns and slippers
and other things to think about.</p>

<p>S. P. affairs had a lull the first of the last
week of school, till Judge Gordon asked Jean
at breakfast Wednesday morning if the club
really had a name, and Jean told him that it
had too many already, but the Stealthy Prowlers
was the only one that was appropriate to
their outdoor purposes. “The trouble is that
we decided on the initials first.”</p>

<p>The judge gave Jean a comical look. “No
doubt you had a good reason,” he said. “Perhaps
if you had a respectable motto it would
help. I can’t say that I admire your name.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">159</a></span>
“I don’t either, Daddy. What could we have
for a motto?”</p>

<p>The judge went into the other room and got
out his Latin lexicon from the book-cases there.
Jean did not disturb him while he turned the
pages and scribbled a little on the back of an
envelope.</p>

<p>“Here is one that you might have,” he said
at last, turning over the envelope and writing
the words in a large hand.</p>

<p>“If you must ‘prowl,’ you might say, ‘<i>Pro
bono, non malo, circumcursamus</i>.’ It means
‘we prowl, or run around for good and not for
evil.’</p>

<p>“Or here is another Latin sentence that might
do. Of course, I’m making them up. It isn’t
from the classics. ‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Bonum non malum insequimur</i>’
sounds still better, but only means ‘we
follow good, not evil.’ How do you like these?”</p>

<p>“Fine. We need some mottos for our club
room anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Why not ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sans peur</i>’?” suggested Mrs.
Gordon, who had followed her husband and
daughter into the living room.</p>

<p>“Oh, Mother!” cried Jean. “Why didn’t I
think of that before? Here we’ve been studying<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">160</a></span>
French and everything! It begins with
S. P., you know.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough,” smiled Judge Gordon, who
did not mind in the least that Jean showed more
enthusiasm over her mother’s suggestion than
his own. “Why don’t you make that the name
of your club as well?”</p>

<p>“The girls will like it,” said Jean, sitting
down in a chair with a beatific expression. “And
the boys will be surprised. Since the party
they’ve been calling us the Sibyl Prophetesses
or Priestesses, and Billy said, ‘Come now Jean,
isn’t “sibyl” a part of it’?”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sans peur</i> will be a fine motto for you wild
hikers,” concluded Judge Gordon, rising and
patting the young shoulder as he passed Jean
to leave the room for the hall. “I must go to
the office. Better call a meeting, Jean, and
change Stealthy Prowlers to something better.”</p>

<p>“The boys said that the ‘Seven Sibyls’ would
be better, with S. S. for our initials, but I told
them that we expected to be more than seven
members after a while.”</p>

<p>“I’d suggest ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sans souci</i>,’ ‘without a care,’
then, for those initials,” said Mrs. Gordon. The
judge was out of the house by this time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">161</a></span>
“We have to stay S. P., Mother, for a very
good reason,” said Jean, thinking of Billy and
her first committing of the girls to a club, “but
the sibyl part is only for initiations and things
like that. Each sibyl has charge of a department,
and it is a very good scheme. But you
mustn’t tell anything I tell you.”</p>

<p>“Never,” promised Mrs. Gordon.</p>

<p>Some of the girls were not so much in favor
of making the motto the name of the club, but
they were agreed that even if <i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sans peur</i> remained
only the motto, it gave the excuse for
calling themselves the S. P. Club. “I move,”
said Phoebe, “that we decide on our pin and
have it an American eagle, because we have so
many around our lakes, and then have a little
pennant or banner or some little place in the
pin with ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sans Peur</i>’ on it.”</p>

<p>“The eagle will stand for our bird hunting,
too,” said Bess.</p>

<p>“It is a good motto, too,” said Molly, “if we
are off camping. We can add it all if we want
to, ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sans peur et sans reproche</i>.’ Not to be
afraid and not to do anything to bring reproach
isn’t so bad for us to remember. Girls, Mother
said to-day that she thought it pretty sure,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">162</a></span>
maybe she said sure, that everybody will let us
go!”</p>

<p>Thursday came, with its graduation exercises.
Friday saw the girls going after their reports.
There seemed to be some repressed excitement
among the Black Wizards, though everything
was so irregular anyway that it was not particularly
noticeable.</p>

<p>“I hope you girls have a good time to-morrow,”
said Billy with a grin at Jean, as he left
the schoolgrounds with Danny Pierce.</p>

<p>“We’re not going on a hike or anything,
Billy,” replied Jean, but Billy just nodded and
went on.</p>

<p>“Billy looked so funny when he said that,”
said Jean to Molly. “Do you suppose he meant
anything was going to happen? What could
the boys do?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t know. The boys are going
to entertain us when they get their camp
finished, I’m sure. But they would send us invitations,
I should think.”</p>

<p>“Of course they would,” said Nan, “though,
knowing Jimmy, I will say that they can do
some very unexpected things.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">163</a></span>
“And Jimmy would say the same thing about
girls, Nan.”</p>

<p>“Yes, he would. Oh, Jean, I wish we could
afford to get our pins now, don’t you? But the
books come first, and we’ll need all we can
raise for the camping equipment, though we can
count on help for that.”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Nan; we might lose our pins
camping, and we may change our minds again,
and there wouldn’t be any chance to show them
to anybody till school begins!”</p>

<p>The girls laughed over Jean’s conclusions and
agreed that they had some point. The groups
of boys and girls separated for the most part.
The next move was taking home the reports,
some to praise, some to disappointment, as it
always happens. But the Black Wizards and
the S. P.’s had some pride of scholarship.</p>

<p>Saturday morning dawned as a beautiful
June day can, clear, bright, fragrant with flowers,
musical with bird songs and fairly cool
with a fresh breeze from the lakes. “I wish we
had planned to do something to-day,” said Jean
to her father. “We were so lazy yesterday,
after Commencement.”</p>

<p>“Drive out into the country with me,” said<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">164</a></span>
the judge. “I’m leaving about nine o’clock.
Your mother’s going with me. Like to take any
of the girls along?”</p>

<p>“Oh, yes, of course. But we can only get five
in the back part, three on the back seat.”</p>

<p>The judge laughed. “You are a great girl.
You want the whole seven, I suppose. Why
don’t you call up Leigh and ask her if her folks
can’t come along? We might make a picnic of
it. I’m going to look at a piece of land and I
wouldn’t mind having Dudley along.”</p>

<p>“But doesn’t he have to be at the bank?”</p>

<p>“Don’t I have to be at my office? Presidents
of banks, my dear, aren’t really as necessary to
the daily job as cashiers and a few others.”</p>

<p>“How lucky for them. Why, do I dare suggest
anything like a picnic to the Dudleys? And
is Mother willing?”</p>

<p>“Ask her.”</p>

<p>“I will put up a lunch if Mrs. Dudley will,”
said Mrs. Gordon with an expression of amusement
that Jean did not understand at the time.
In a moment Jean was at the telephone.</p>

<p>“Why, isn’t that luck for you, Leigh!” Jean
was heard exclaiming. “Has just asked you if
you wouldn’t like a ride into the country? Well,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">165</a></span>
anybody would on a day like this. Whom do
you want to take? Phoebe, I suppose? All right.
I’ll get Nan and Molly, then, if you want to take
the rest.” Jean flew out of the open front door
without stopping to explain, for she knew that
her parents could overhear what she said to
Leigh.</p>

<p>Mrs. Gordon was at the telephone herself as
soon as Jean had gone. She sent several messages
rapidly, but was in the kitchen packing a
large basket when Jean returned. “My, you’re
taking a lot of things!” Jean exclaimed.</p>

<p>“With the Dudleys, my dear, I want to have
something to offer, you see. It is a good thing
I did my baking yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Why, so you did. When did you ever do
that before? I’m glad now that you wouldn’t
cut that cake for supper. And I don’t suppose
the girls will have a chance to bring much. I
told Nan and Molly that I’d take enough for
them. Was that all right?”</p>

<p>“Perfectly. Make a few more cheese sandwiches,
Jean, and we’ll soon be ready. I think
I’ll put in those cookies, too. We can buy
something for Sunday if we’re all eaten out of
baked things.” Mrs. Gordon said nothing about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">166</a></span>
the fat meat loaf in the bottom of the basket or
the chicken which she had fried while Jean was
at Nan’s Friday afternoon. She looked like a
little older edition of Jean as she hurried
around with flushed cheeks.</p>

<p>Presently they were all out upon the pretty
river road, the Dudley car overtaking them.
The girls leaned out to call to each other, as the
machines drew abreast for a short distance. “I
think we’ll go on to what the youngsters call
Baldy for our lunch, Dudley. What do you
think?” asked Judge Gordon.</p>

<p>“You could not find a better place,” Mr. Dudley
replied. “Take the lead. I’ll follow.”</p>

<p>So the two gentlemen were not looking up the
“piece of land” at once. The girls were quite
satisfied, but wished that they had thought to
bring their bathing suits. They crossed the
river by the big bridge, took a roundabout route
by fairly good roads through the beautiful, undulating
country with its frequent pools and
tiny lakes. Stretches of woodland or pastures
and fields were equally attractive, but at length
they came to the thick woods where a road ran
in for a little way, then changed from lane to
footpath.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">167</a></span>
“Isn’t this the grandest woods?” asked Jean,
whose favorite adjective was “grand.” The
other girls agreed that it was and that it was a
shame they could not come more often to this
lake. Yet it was too far for an ordinary hike and
the machines of the parents were not available,
as a rule. These facts were mentioned, and the
girls did not notice a lad who viewed the party
from a woodsy distance and then noiselessly
slipped away to give the word.</p>

<p>The two fathers carried the two large baskets,
while the two mothers and girls brought
the light blankets used in the cars in cool
weather. These would do to spread upon the
ground. Various small articles which had not
found room in the basket were distributed. “My,
but we’re going to have a big lunch!” cried Nan.
“It’s a regular S. P. picnic. I wish my mother
and father could ever get away for one. Poor
Dad! Always at the office!”</p>

<p>The girls ran on ahead, as girls do. The
mothers and fathers exchanged glances. “It
worked out better than I was afraid it would,”
said Mrs. Gordon. “Jean doesn’t suspect a
thing.”</p>

<p>“I’m relieved that the secrecy is over,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">168</a></span>
though,” said Mrs. Dudley with a smile. “Now
we’ll see how they like it. I hope everybody
is here. You took us for a fine ride around,
Judge Gordon.”</p>

<p>“I tried to give everybody time enough, Mrs.
Dudley.” The judge looked at his watch. “Just
eleven. They’ll be here. I suppose that the
boys have been having their scouts out to watch
us and report. Jimmy Standish was the only
one who had to wait, on Nan’s account, and
drive his father and mother.”</p>

<p>It took probably ten minutes of walking
through the woods by the pretty trail before
they came to the sloping shores of the lake that
stretched its shining ripples so invitingly before
them. “Why, Mother!” exclaimed Jean,
looking to the left toward a cleared space,
“Someone has been building a summer cottage!
Oh, it must be the Black Wizards!” For Judge
Gordon gave a little whistle and from behind
the house the boys came running, Jimmy and
Billy in the lead.</p>

<p>“How do you like the house, Jean?” asked
Billy, all grins.</p>

<p>“Grand! What a beautiful surprise! It will
beat our Attic Party to smithereens! Why, this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">169</a></span>
is wonderful of you, to get up a surprise picnic
like this. Oh, it’s a cute little cottage. I hope
you will take us inside of it.”</p>

<p>“We certainly will.”</p>

<p>The other boys were in similar conversation
with the other S. P.’s&mdash;but here came other
folks around the house. The various fathers
and mothers! The S. P.’s gasped. The boys
had not left them out in celebrating the finishing
of their summer camp! All the S. P. parents,
all the Black Wizard parents, so far as
they could tell in a hasty glance at the group,
were there.</p>

<p>But Judge Gordon was coming to the front
and raising his hand. “I think that some explanation
is due these surprised girls of ours.
They ought to know that their energy and that
of our boys has made some of us parents realize
what should be done to help them. Among
other things we have seen that the outdoor
movements are a good thing, properly managed,
and we decided to help a little there.</p>

<p>“Then it happens that both boys and girls
have been talking about books, and it made us
see that there was not even a proper school
library of reference books to say nothing of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">170</a></span>
library in the town where they could gather for
reading. Your little nature library, girls, and
the boys’ few books on adventure and history
have started more than you knew. Some of us
fathers got together the other day. We are all
of us, boys and girls and older boys and girls,
going to start raising money together next fall,
or even before, for a public library; and probably
we shall not stop there, with our progressive
town paper to back us.” The judge waved
his hand at Mr. Standish as he said this.</p>

<p>“And whether S. P. refers to sugar plums,
sweet peas, seraphic peris or a sane purpose
and secure partnership, we give them the credit
for calling our attention to the needs of our little
city. They have shown us <em>Stirring Possibilities</em>
and have already assured us some <i>Social
Progress</i>! I understand that they are intending
to enlarge their club with that purpose.
Jean, can you tell us what your club stands
for?”</p>

<p>Jean, absolutely surprised, thought for a moment
that she could not say a word. It was
dreadful of her father to ask her to make a
speech. But while she hesitated, led out from
the midst of the girls by Nan, her father said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">171</a></span>
“No speech, Jean; but you are the president, I
believe.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. Why,&mdash;some of us a good while
ago had been wishing that we knew more about
what other girls were doing and something suddenly
decided us to have a club. That was all.
Then, of course, having started it, we kept on
and Miss Haynes helped us find out about a
great many things, and we decided to raise
money for a library. First it was just our own
and then we wondered if we couldn’t do something
about a school library. But it is wonderful
that all of you are thinking about a town
library and all I can say for us girls is that we
will help all we can, and make fudge by the&mdash;quart,
and everything! And thank you for the
surprise of this picnic.” Jean’s usually quick
mind could think of nothing more to say and she
stepped back in some confusion.</p>

<p>“Just a moment, girls, now that you are getting
used to surprises,” said the judge. “I believe
that I will ask the editor to tell you whose
summer cottage this is,&mdash;Mr. Standish.”</p>

<p>Jean gasped again. Now she knew. This
was not the Black Wizard shack. The tall judge
stepped back and the wiry, slight, editor, Nan’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">172</a></span>
father, stepped forward from a group. “This
should all be very informal,” said he, “as it is
a picnic occasion. It seems to fall to me to announce
to our girls that the S. P. Club owns
this little cottage and that it is a gift from the
S. P. fathers and mothers, who have fitted it up
very simply. The boys helped build it and I
assure you that we all had a time of it to keep
it a secret, but I believe that it was done. We
hope that it will be a happy surprise to you and
that you may have a very good time of it this
summer. The boys want me to announce to you
that they, too, have a camp about a mile around
the lake from here and that after you have
looked at your new house, the picnic will be held
there.”</p>

<p>As Mr. Standish closed, Jean looked at her
father, who nodded encouragingly. She felt
stunned as well as happy to know that this summer
camp was theirs, but her mind had been
working this time. “Oh,” she began impulsively,
“you know how we must feel, Mr. Standish,
more like crying for joy! I couldn’t say anything
if I weren’t the president and have to.
We’ll all be thanking our fathers and mothers
separately, and every one of the boys for helping<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">173</a></span>
do this. So all I’m saying now is just
thank you, everybody!”</p>

<p>Jean turned to her mother and put her head
on that comfortable shoulder for a minute, but
a sudden thought made her swallow the lump
in her throat and she turned to Nan and the rest
of the astonished, ecstatic girls. “Oh, say, girls,
let me whisper something to you,” and she whispered
to Nan, who nodded and passed the word
on to the nearest girl, while Jean told someone
else. That message no one but the S. P.’s were
ever to know. “Let’s never tell the boys that
we knew they were building,” said Jean. It was
not much, to be sure, but no unpleasant note of
rivalry could ever be struck between the S. P.’s
and the Black Wizards!</p>

<p>The commotion now began. The girls were
beckoned into the little house that was theirs
by the parents, who wanted to see how they
liked it. The boys scattered, some of them taking
the baskets and wraps brought by the Dudleys
and Gordons. These were carried to the
other camp by boat, for a little fleet of row-boats,
canoes and one small motor boat was
waiting to take the picnickers to where the other
“opening” was to be celebrated.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">174</a></span>
“Daddy, I forgot to tell them about our
motto. And you thought up the best name yet
for us, a Social Progress Club.”</p>

<p>“That daughter, was on the spur of the moment.
Was it too much to give you such a big
surprise with no warning?”</p>

<p>“Oh, it is just too wonderful. I can’t tell you
how happy I am, and I know the other girls
feel the same way. Just look at them!”</p>

<p>The summer cottage stood facing the path
and lane in a measure, but with its back to the
lake. It was explained that the road was to be
widened, to permit of driving to the house with
supplies and that it seemed better to have the
front face in that direction. “But your screened
sleeping porch is toward the lake,” one of the
fathers showed them, “and your main room
out upon the water.”</p>

<p>Neat, trim, painted white, with golden brown
storm shutters, and made of boards closely set,
the little house justified the girls’ exclamations.
It was not plastered inside, but it was tight and
snug against ordinary winds. One immense
room with a pantry and a large closet opening
at one side, and the long sleeping porch across
the back, constituted the interior. “That big<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">175</a></span>
closet, girls, could be made into a bathroom,”
said Mrs. Dudley, “if a water system could be
arranged some time. But you will be glad of all
the hooks in there, now, and a place for your
luggage. Be careful of that coal-oil stove, and
the big range will keep you warm in a cold spell.
There is money for a little set of dishes and
some kitchenware, and we thought that it would
be more fun for you to buy it yourselves and
fix up the place. Do you like the color the boys
painted the floor?”</p>

<p>The girls liked everything; what fun it was
going to be, to buy things for their summer
cottage.</p>

<p>“Notice,” said one mother, “that there are
keys and also bolts on all the doors. We feel
much safer to have you in a house like this.
With Grace here and the boys only a mile away,
you ought to be safe. Jimmy said something
about rigging up a telephone, and I hope they
do it.”</p>

<p>“To think that our fathers, as well as the
boys, drove some of the nails in this!” rather
sentimentally said Leigh. “I’d like to stay right
out here to-night!”</p>

<p>“You would find it rather inconvenient,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">176</a></span>
Leigh,” laughed her mother. “We did not like
to buy blankets and things and leave them here.
There is time enough.”</p>

<p>So there was. After lingering looks all
around, the girls were willing to leave in the
boats for the other camp, where they were
shown all over the little peninsula which the
boys had chosen as a site. The boys’ “Shack,”
as they called it was not as smooth as the girls’
and as yet unpainted, but it was well built, for
they had had the assistance of carpenters on
this as on the other. The main room was more
open and the boys would sleep in bunks. “Got
lots of windows, you see, and if it rains in, it
can’t hurt our floor.”</p>

<p>“Lookout for what you call your port holes,
Billy,” said Nan, to Billy, who had made this
remark. “You want to keep the rain from your
bunks at least.”</p>

<p>The picnic was held outdoors, on a slope
which overlooked the lake. There were not so
many Black Wizard parents as the girls had
at first supposed, but most of the sisters had
come, and the S. P.’s decided to invite some of
them to visit their camp during the weeks there,
if Grace were willing. It would be such a shame<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">177</a></span>
to keep all that fun to themselves. “We could
have them all, in relays, couldn’t we, Jean?”
asked Nan.</p>

<p>“We certainly could, and several are the right
age to join the S. P.’s. Daddy just told me that
he and Mr. Standish and Mr. Dudley and Mr.
Baxter have bought up a lot of the land around
this end of the lake, to make it safe and keep
it wild for us, and to put up a few more little
shacks if we want any more campers. I’m so
stunned over it that I don’t know who I am!”</p>

<p>The girls, in spite of their dazed condition
which they claimed, threw themselves into the
boys’ celebration heartily and raved as girls
are supposed to do over the location and plans.
Nor did they forget to be sincere in their thanks
for the Wizards’ part in the great surprise. “It
was perfectly grand!” cried Jean, with a sandwich
in one hand and a chicken wing in the
other.</p>

<h2><a name="xiii" id="xiii"></a>CHAPTER XIII<br />
<span>THE S. P.’S DISCOVER GRETA</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Greta</span> wakened to the sound of rain, beating
upon the old roof and leaking into her attic.
The first drops beat a tattoo within the old tin
pan that she kept under the worst leak. What
had happened? Oh, yes. She remembered,
though her head had stopped aching. It was
sore, though, under the bandage. She heard the
children downstairs only faintly. Why, they
must be up and about, all of the family,&mdash;and
no one had called her. What Greta did not
know was that the “horse-doctor” had warned
Mrs. Klein in no uncertain words that Greta
had had a dangerous fall and must be allowed
to rest for fear of serious consequences. “And
you know that it might be looked into, how she
got it,” he had said, for he thought that he noted
suspicious anxiety on her part. Jacob Klein’s
character was not unknown in these parts.</p>

<p>With her foot Greta felt that her precious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">179</a></span>
book was safely there. She wondered if she
could think of a better place. How soon would
she be called? It was so cloudy that she had no
way of knowing what time it was. The old
clock downstairs did not strike and half the
time it did not even go.</p>

<p>After a little she heard her mother telling the
children to go back and coming, lumbering, up
the attic stairs. Greta’s big eyes were fixed
on her as she came into the low room, complaining
in voluble German that it had to be a rainy
day and that the doctor had said Greta could
not work. She would have the washings to
start herself. A cup of coffee and a piece of
bread, broken from a loaf, were put down on a
chair by the bed.</p>

<p>Greta expected to be ordered up then, but no,
her mother turned to go, telling her to do what
the doctor said about the medicine. “He hit
you?” she asked, and Greta answered that “he”
had.</p>

<p>Greta could scarcely believe her good fortune.
She was not even to take care of the children,
poor little things, kept in by the rain. As soon
as her mother had gone downstairs, Greta sat
up and unpinned the bandage on her head. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">180</a></span>
was a little dizzy, but she poured some water
from her old pitcher into the tin basin which
was her lavatory and bathed the cut. She anointed
it and tied up her head again, as the
doctor had directed, taking a tablet, too, to
swallow down with the black coffee. A whole
day to herself! A book to read.</p>

<p>Something was queer. Oh, yes, what they
had said. She was not Jacob Klein’s daughter.
How had she learned to speak English as well
as the summer cottagers did, and better than
some of them? Why had her German been
“forgotten,” as they had said, when she was so
sick with brain fever? She tried to remember
those first days, four years before, when she
found herself getting strong enough to sit up
and then to walk. Mrs. Klein had been kinder
then. “Why, I can, too, remember,” she said
to herself, as a scene rose before her of herself
in a dark woods, frightened and running. Then
someone picked her up. Oh, it was coming
back! But she grew dizzy again as she sat up
in her desire to remember and the excitement
of it. She would not think till she was better.</p>

<p>Of course it had always seemed funny that
she knew English; but Mrs. Klein had always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">181</a></span>
told her that she went to school with English
children. “Maybe you would ferget one t’ing,
maybe another,” Jacob Klein had said to a
frightened little girl. “Dis time it vas German
dot you fergot, und don’t ferget vat ve tells
you some more!” Greta could remember the
threatening look and the ugly tone with which
he had bent over her bed and said this.</p>

<p>For another half hour Greta rested and tried
not to think at all. Then she drank the rest of
the cold coffee and ate the bread, at last reaching
down under the old quilt for her precious
book, in which she was absorbed immediately.</p>

<p>The book wore a bright cover with pictures
of girls about her own age, but how different
they appeared! There were pretty, stylish
dresses, happy faces, and yet some of the pictures
found them in a woods like hers. At first
they were in a boarding school and what good
times they had in between lessons. There was
one that she liked especially, but she loved them
all. And she had seen things like that. Why,
of <em>course</em> she had been to school.</p>

<p>Greta read the book through and began to
read it again, though she had hastily thrust it
under the covers when she heard her mother<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">182</a></span>
coming upstairs again. A glass of milk and a
hard-boiled egg with a spoonful of mush made
a marvelous meal, for Greta was hungry by the
middle of the afternoon; and her mother explained
that as the doctor had said she was not
to eat much, two meals were enough and this
was the last. Karl had almost scalded himself
from a kettle on the stove and Minna had bluing
all over her. Greta was to get up early the
next morning to do another washing and to
iron. With this cross ultimatum, Mrs. Klein
left the room.</p>

<p>Before night Greta rose, bathed a little to refresh
her tired body and lit a short candle
which she kept on her small stand. She read
by this light until she heard the family coming
up to bed. Then she blew out her candle and
crept into her bed with her book, happier than
she had been for many a long day. And a little
prayer in English came to her that night.</p>

<p>“Was it being frightened by a storm in the
woods that made me sick that time?” she asked
her mother the next day, interested to see Mrs.
Klein look up quickly, as if a little startled.</p>

<p>“Nein, Nein!” she exclaimed, but she told
Greta to stop thinking about that time. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">183</a></span>
might get sick again. Greta said nothing more,
but she noticed that her mother looked at her
from time to time with a frown. There was
<em>something</em> about that time and about those
earlier years of Greta’s that she must know,
Greta thought, and she <em>would</em> know! Another
thing. She would not stay in the same room
with the man that she had always thought her
father when he was in those ugly moods. No
more waiting on him and dodging his ready
hand. Still, if she stayed in his house,&mdash;and it
had belonged to his father and grandfather,&mdash;how
could she manage it? It did look like a
hopeless future until she could in some way free
herself of the family life, and work away from
home. Her mind was busy as she worked.</p>

<p>Life went on as usual, except that Jacob
Klein was drinking less and was working on his
little farm, all that was left of his larger inheritance.
They sold eggs and some vegetables
from the garden and even the milk from the
one cow to the few families in the cottages. But
when Greta was out in the boat, fishing occasionally,
she noticed that there was more building
in different places around the lake. That
any of those cottages would mean anything to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">184</a></span>
her, she had no idea other than that they might
make more work for her to do. There were
two more along the lake where she docked her
rowboat to collect and deliver the clothes. The
Wizard shack she could see from the lake; but
that of the girls she had not noticed at all, for
her fishing ground was not in that direction as
a rule and a turn in the shore concealed with
the foliage of many trees the little bay on which
the new cottage stood.</p>

<p>The fifteenth of June came. Greta had kept
her promise firm in regard to that date. She
was doing the larger part of the work as she
had since she was at all able to do it. It would
do no harm to run away from it all for one day.
She was sorry for her mother, but it was becoming
a question in her mind whether a real
mother could put such heavy work on a young
girl that was her own child. If her leaving for
a day made trouble, she would walk to the village
and ask for work. That was settled.</p>

<p>As she was supposed to get up earlier than
the rest, it made little difference whether the
attic boards creaked under her light footsteps
or not. She went quietly down the stairs and
heated coffee for her breakfast. The feeding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">185</a></span>
she did first, though she did not let the dogs out
to follow her. They would go with Jacob Klein,
who had said that he was going to the village.
She hesitated about milking the cow, but finally
did so, for fear that the family would sleep too
late or it would not be done at all.</p>

<p>Then away she sped, fleet-footed, feeling that
if anyone called her back it would be a calamity
that she could not bear. Her book was under
her arm. The sagging pockets of her old black
sweater carried bread and cheese. But she did
not take her usual dive and swim. It was too
near home. Someone might waken and come
to find her. On and on she went, into a part
of the woods that she scarcely ever had visited.
Sometimes she went down to the shore, but not
till she was far enough away to prevent her being
seen from the shore near home. Squirrels
scolded a little. Nesting birds fluttered past,
or sang. She found the nest of a wood thrush,
with its usual bit of cloth interwoven. It was
in plain sight, in the crotch of a tree, with the
mother bird upon it. Her mate sat on the
branch of a neighboring tree and sang his
“Come to me,” with variations. Over the lake a
great bald eagle flew with a fish. Swallows<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">186</a></span>
skimmed the water. Greta felt as free as the
birds, and since that blow of Jacob Klein’s she
had no sense of neglected duty.</p>

<p>Rounding the curve of the east shore, she
caught her first glimpse of the cottage built for
the S. P.’s. At first she stepped back behind
the trees and bushes for fear of being seen.
Then she saw that there was no one about.
Gradually she drew nearer. She climbed the
gentle ascent, cautiously approached, looked
into the windows and went all around the house.
What a pretty, new cottage it was, with its
brown and yellowish trimmings, its golden-brown
floor inside and neat, light cots. No one
was living there yet, that was certain, for there
was nothing on the table and the cots were bare.
How clean it all was!</p>

<p>Greta sat down on the front step to rest and
look about, but she had been there only a few
minutes when she heard voices. Some one was
coming! She flew across the cleared space,
where a few evidences of sawdust and chips remained.
To conceal herself from view was easy
enough in the clump of trees and young growths
near at hand. Girls, laughing and talking!
And a few boys with them!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">187</a></span>
“Go easy on that suitcase, Billy. That’s got
our ducky breakfast set in it. Dishes, Billy, the
sweetest set, yellow and white, with daisies.
That’s our company set. Our common dishes
are in those other baskets. Here, Jimmy, let
me help you with that one.”</p>

<p>She was pretty, that first one with the sparkling
brown eyes. Then here came an older girl,
tall, fair and rather pale. “Don’t worry about
me, Fran,” she was saying to a girl as tall behind
her, “I’m only tired with too much going
on. I’m perfectly able to carry these blankets.”</p>

<p>Greta counted. There were eight girls, and
three boys, all with blankets across their shoulders
and their hands full of packages or baskets
or pails or something in the housekeeping
line. It was interesting. She would stay and
watch them a little while. Somewhere she had
learned that it was not nice to be curious. That
might be one of those vivid dreams or memories
that came to her now, by night or day. Nevertheless,
she could do no harm, and oh, how full
of fun those girls were. They were like the
girls in the book. They were like,&mdash;girls that
she had either dreamed of or known.</p>

<p>All of them made several trips back and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">188</a></span>
forth. They had wagons or a truck in the
woods, she supposed. She had noticed the lane,
but had never been to its other end. The
younger two boys marched gaily with a broom
and a new mop over their shoulders, a dish pan
inverted over each head, and more blankets under
each arm. The one called Billy tried a dance
step, but a blanket became unrolled and all but
tripped him.</p>

<p>“Don’t spoil the new mop, Billy!”</p>

<p>“That’s all the sympathy I get, is it Nan?”</p>

<p>“I was just trying to be clever, Billy. I’ll
trust you with my camp trousseau in my suitcase
the next trip.”</p>

<p>More boxes and bundles were carried inside.
Then came the supplies. Greta had never seen
so much to eat together as this except in stores,
and, to be sure, growing in fields and orchards.
But these baskets bore selected foods for home
use, or camp use. There were two large sacks
of flour and large boxes containing cans of all
sorts. But Greta tired of looking at what they
were bringing. It was far more interesting to
see the girls themselves and to listen to the gay
chatter.</p>

<p>“Please put those cans of coal-oil out on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">189</a></span>
kitchenette stoop, Billy. Mother was so afraid
that we’d set them near the flour or some of the
other food. Everything else goes in the pantry,
everything else to eat, I mean. We girls will
arrange them. Why, yes, if you have to take
the baskets and boxes back, put the stuff anywhere.
Leave us the box with the potatoes,
though. Oh, yes, just dump those things into
the dishpan or the washbasin or anything.
And thanks so much. You three get our first
invitation to a meal from our new dishes. I
don’t know whether this is camping or going
to housekeeping, but we’ll have a mixture of
both, it is likely. Are you all set at your camp?”</p>

<p>“Yes. We can use a few more things, but we
can bring back what we want after we take the
truck back to town and come back in our Ford.
Now shan’t we bring up your machine? It’s
going to be hard to get it through till we get
the lane widened a little more. You can make
it, of course, but we’ll be over as soon as possible
to cut away some of the stuff. The carpenters
zigzagged through and nearly spoiled
some of the young trees.”</p>

<p>“All right, boys. Bring our limousine into
its shed, if you please. Did you say that we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">190</a></span>
could get our supplies nearer the camp than at
home? Oh, yes. I remember that village.
We’ve driven through it.”</p>

<p>From her fancied security behind some
spruces, Greta looked and wished that she were
a part of the pleasure she saw. Then <a name="Jean" id="Jean"></a>Jean,
whisking back from the truck and machines by
a shorter cut, almost ran into Greta, who rose,
wide-eyed and startled.</p>

<p>“Oh!” exclaimed Jean. “Excuse me! I didn’t
know any one was here. Did you want to see
us?”</p>

<p>“I&mdash;I happened to come around the lake and
I saw your cottage. I didn’t know any one was
building here. Then,&mdash;then you all came&mdash;and
you were having such a good time&mdash;and I just
waited to go.”</p>

<p>“Do you live near here?”</p>

<p>“Not very near. It must be two miles around
the shore.”</p>

<p>“This bay runs in so that it isn’t any wonder
you’ve not seen the house. Come to see us some
time. We’re just getting settled now and we’re
going to be here most of the summer.”</p>

<p>Just then Grace French from the house
called, “Jean, Jean!”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">191</a></span>
“I have to run,” said Jean, smiling at Greta.
“Goodbye.”</p>

<p>Greta at once went farther back among the
trees, making a wide circle to avoid the truck
and machines; but she found a quiet, grassy
spot in the woods at no great distance from the
lane and there she sat down to read her book,
eat her bread and cheese and listen sometimes
to distant laughter.</p>

<h2><a name="xiv" id="xiv"></a>CHAPTER XIV<br />
<span>LITTLE ADVENTURES OF CAMP LIFE</span></h2>


<p>“<span class="smcap">Yes</span>, dear Mother, you were right when you
supposed that we are having a good time. It is
not only good, but gorgeous.” So Jean Gordon’s
letter began.</p>

<p>“The committee on supplies and communications,
as we call Billy and Jimmy, whom Billy
so adores, brought me your note and will take
this, to mail it Saturday. I’m glad that you and
Dad are to have that fine trip. No, I’m not
disappointed not to go along and thanks for the
invitation, if I would really prefer to go. I
couldn’t leave the girls and I’ll probably get
East some day.</p>

<p>“Billy told me a lot of things about the boys’
camp, and said that Jimmy put in a lot of
money that he has made along, at the office, reporting,
doing some press work, whatever that
is, and everything. His father pays him. But
the boys are only borrowing of him and I think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">193</a></span>
that they are having as great a time as we are.
They are in the lake about half the time. At
least we always see them when we go out. Billy
offered to take me in his canoe, but Grace won’t
let me go until I learn to swim better, for canoes
are ‘not so safe,’ she says. I can float, though,
and swim a little. I’m so mad at myself to
think that I never wanted to swim,&mdash;and all my
life near the lakes! Disgusting! Fran and
Bess are like fish in the water, and even Molly
can do better than I can. Just wait, though,
till this summer is over. Tell my father, by the
way, that we all appreciate this little bay that
the fathers chose for us. We can wade out and
swim in the shallower water without worrying
Grace, and the boys have rigged up a diving
place, whatever you call it, just like what they
have.</p>

<p>“Grace is catching up in sleep and feels fine.
She makes us all take an early dip and have setting
up exercises, for every camp that amounts
to anything does that, she says. Then we can
plan our day ourselves, and you ought to see
the fish we catch <em>and cook</em>, if you please. It was
so cold that we made a big fire in the range yesterday
and used a little of that coal, too, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">194</a></span>
mostly we burn wood, and we baked biscuit
that turned out all right and had maple molasses
with them. Yes, the coal-oil stove works
all right and we are careful. Grace usually
oversees our efforts to cook. We have had fires
outdoors, too, right on what beach we have, and
we do everything that careful woodsmen&mdash;and
woodswomen&mdash;do. So don’t have a worry while
you are gone. We lock up every night and
everything.</p>

<p>“You ought to see our pantry! The cans look
fine, all in a row on one shelf. The sack of flour
stands in a box with white paper in it to catch
what we spill. We tacked up a little curtain of
what was left of our peacock stuff over the shelf
that has our precious dishes. But we have been
tearing around outdoors so much that we
haven’t used them but once. Then we’re still
painting our chairs off and on. The yellow paint
we got turned out all right. Molly and Phoebe
are chief artists, but I always knew that I was
artistic even if I couldn’t draw, you know!
House-painting and furniture will be my specialty,
and we think it safer to put on the bright
pictures by&mdash;let’s see, decalcomania, they call
it, I think. Some kind of mania, anyhow, I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">195</a></span>
think. But Phoebe has drawn a line that we
make that golden-brown, which gives a nice
contrast with the yellow, after we get that on.
The only trouble is that we need the chairs to
use, so progress is slow, doing about two at
a time.</p>

<p>“Mr. Lockhart sent the most wonderful binoculars
out for Fran. She was so surprised
and pleased! Some of us get out pretty early
to see what is singing over our heads and we
have enough glasses now to get our identifications
of even the little birds pretty sure. We
are glad that we brought all our nature books
along. And we have found a girl who lives near
the lake and knows where different birds nest.
She took me to see a wood thrush’s nest, such
a pretty, or odd one, only yesterday. I’ll have
to tell you about her. She’s a sort of mystery.</p>

<p>“I nearly ran into her the day we brought
everything out and went to housekeeping. Oh,
it was the greatest fun, Mother, to move into
our own playhouse, so to speak! But you have
listened to me rave about that before.</p>

<p>“I was scampering through the trees with
something from the truck when lo and behold,
here, in the midst of some spruces, was this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">196</a></span>
girl. Just imagine a thin face with big brown
eyes and a scared look when she saw me, an old
fuzzy black sweater that was whole but looked
awful, a patched old purple skirt, faded, and
dipping up here and down there, no stockings
at all and some old shoes that were tied on. I
suppose she wore them to save her feet going
through the woods. Her hair was short and
just the curly kind that I’ve always wished
mine was, but it was brushed straight back
from her face, as if she’d tried to get the curl
out.</p>

<p>“I asked her if she wanted to see us and she
seemed to be more scared than ever and sort of
apologized. She said that she just happened
on the house and when we came we seemed to
be having so much fun that she just waited a
minute,&mdash;something like that. Grace called me
and I didn’t see her any more, though I told
Grace and she said that we would lock up well.
Nobody knew who might be around.</p>

<p>“Next thing, Fran made a remark that she
has hated herself for ever since. We were exploring
real early one morning, led on by a bird
we couldn’t locate, and we came to the prettiest
spot where there is a big willow tree, the kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">197</a></span>
that you want right away to climb into. Well,
we climbed, and there, high up, the funniest
bathing suit you ever saw was hanging. It
looked like a sack and was made of pieces of
different colored cloth.</p>

<p>“‘Well, look at this!’ Fran exclaimed.
‘Here’s the last word in bathing suits. It reminds
me of Joseph’s coat of many colors; and
notice the combination, will you? Whoever put
such a thing as that together? It’s all wet, so
somebody has actually worn it!’</p>

<p>“Fran had no idea that anybody would hear
her, for we had been all over the place, we
thought, but she had hardly gotten the words
out of her mouth when we saw a girl hurrying
away from a clump of bushes. It was the same
girl that I’d seen near our camp. She turned
and looked back, and I saw that she was crying
a little, but she whisked her head around and
got some trees between us in a jiffy. ‘Oh!’ said
Fran, ‘wasn’t that awful? Was that the girl
you saw, Jean? And I’ve broken her heart by
laughing at her bathing suit. I never thought!’</p>

<p>“None of us said a word to make Fran feel
any worse about it, but I got to thinking. Of
course she had to have something to wear in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">198</a></span>
lake, and that was all she could put together.
They must be awfully poor or something. But
she couldn’t have been really mad about it, for
she came to camp with a basket of vegetables
from their garden, she said, and asked if we
wanted to buy any. Fran was there and saw
her. She rushed out and said at once that we’d
take all she would let us have. Fran was real
cordial; and sober as she is, I saw a funny
twinkle come into the girl’s eyes when she
looked at Fran, who was digging into her big
purse. She thanked us very politely and went
away at once. She had on a real respectable
gingham dress this time, though it was a funny
plaid and made in a terribly old-fashioned way.</p>

<p>“I asked her if her folks had any eggs to sell
and she said they did sometimes. So she
brought us eggs and the next time we had an
early bird hunt we saw her in the woods and
I went with her to see the wood thrush’s nest.
Her name is Greta Klein. Nan is going to ask
Jimmy if he ever heard of the Kleins. The
name is German, you see, but her English is as
good as ours,&mdash;oh, I hear you laugh at that. It
isn’t saying very much for it, I know. Still,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">199</a></span>
there is a difference when you really can talk
correctly, even if you do not always do it.</p>

<p>“We are taking turns at the cooking, as we
said we should. So far we have not let Grace
do one thing except superintend. The cooks
submit the menus to her to see if they have a
‘balanced meal.’ But sometimes if we have a
long hike and everybody is tired, we just all
pitch in and get up what there is double quick.
It is so beautiful here, Mother, and we all love
it!”</p>

<p>With a little more Jean ended the long letter
to her mother. Greta could have verified what
was said about her. She had, indeed, been hurt
at Fran’s remark, though the tears had been
from a rare breakdown and discouragement,
when she had found a place in the bushes to
cry it out after her morning swim. A great
scolding she had had after the day in the woods.
Her mother had asked her if she had gone crazy
and Greta had replied that she would have to
have a rest once in a while if she had so much
to do. “Either that, Mother, or I shall go away
to work,” she had said firmly.</p>

<p>Mrs. Klein grew very angry and kept after
her constantly with more to do than ever, telling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">200</a></span>
her that she would teach her if she could
go off for a whole day with washings to do and
cooking and feeding and children under foot.
She threatened to beat Greta, but Greta said,
“Why can’t you work more with me and not
put most of the hard work on me? I’ll work
gladly to help earn some money for us; but if
Jacob Klein amounted to anything as a farmer
we wouldn’t be so poor.”</p>

<p>This enraged Mrs. Klein more than ever. She
advanced threateningly toward the girl, till
Greta ran out of the house and her mother
called to her to come back and iron the clothes
for Mrs. Smith. Greta returned, warily, but
Mrs. Klein told her to sprinkle the clothes and
then mix the bread while she went to see where
the children were.</p>

<p>Such was the state of things, with Greta
thinking more and more that there was something
strange about her relations with the man
and woman who had called themselves her parents.
Flashes of memory returned, or what she
hoped was memory, though dim. She had always
recalled some clothing that she had
thought was hers as she came back to life after
the fever, but she saw the dress being made over<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">201</a></span>
for the little boy, then in dresses. How could
she ever find out about anything?</p>

<p>The presence of the girls at their camp was
one source of pleasure, if somewhat tantalizing.
She told her mother about a camp at that end
of the lake and asked if she might not sell their
eggs and vegetables to them. To this Mrs. Klein
agreed, more readily than ever after the sale to
Fran and the good price that she paid. Long
evenings in the garden Greta spent, plying a
busy hoe against the weeds. That the campers
were girls she did not mention, but their bright
faces were often before her. They led a different
life, a life that had something ahead of
it, for she saw them with their books and field
glasses, or taking their early dip and rowing
about the lake. Sometimes she swam nearly to
the little bay when she thought that she had
time.</p>

<p>Then she met them on the unfortunate occasion
of Fran’s remark and again when she fell
in with Jean on a very early stroll toward their
camp. By that time Jean had heard from Jimmy
that the Klein house was across the lake from
the Wizards’ shack and that Jacob Klein was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">202</a></span>
a lazy ne’er-do-well, who drank and abused his
family. “Poor Greta!” thought Jean.</p>

<p>It happened next that Jean, Molly and Nan
took a longer hike than they had intended and
found themselves coming out of the woods upon
a narrow road that led to the lake, as they could
see. At a little distance they saw a house and
decided to stop and ask for a drink of water.</p>

<span>MOLLY’S ADVENTURE</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">It</span> was late in the afternoon. As it happened,
Greta had taken the children with her to deliver
clothes. They could at least sit in the boat to
watch one basket while she delivered the other.
In consequence, no dingy children were at the
Klein gate when Jean and the other two girls
entered. Even the dogs were away with their
master, who was as a rule more kind to them
than to his children.</p>

<p>The gate of a rickety fence stood open. A
few hens ran about the yard with some long-legged
young chickens. The girls entered the
yard, hesitating a little as they walked up to
the door, which stood open revealing anything
but a well-kept room inside. They rapped, intending
to ask if they might find the well, for
Jean had her collapsible cup with her. There
was no response.</p>

<p>“Out in the field, I suppose,” said Molly.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">204</a></span>
“Let’s see if we can find the well. It can’t do
any harm, and I’m perishing for a drink. That
woods was fearfully hot, I thought.”</p>

<p>Turning from the door, the girls started
around the house. There were two old pumps,
and while the girls were guessing which was
the well and which was the cistern, they heard
the sound of crying, a faint moaning, further
back in the yard, it seemed. Toward the left
there stood an old barn and sheds, with the sty,
odorous and muddy. But toward the right
there was a tangle of bushes and fruit trees, to
all appearances from where they stood.</p>

<p>They listened, Molly with her fingers to her
lips. “Perhaps we’d better go on,” whispered
Nan.</p>

<p>“No,” returned Molly, “some one might be
hurt. Wait. I’ll see.”</p>

<p>Molly tiptoed in the direction of the sound,
but as she went loud sobbing broke out. Jean
and Nan were for getting away. That did not
sound like any one who was injured. Perhaps
they would intrude. But Molly was obviously
seeing something or some one. She was looking
soberly ahead, then put her head on one side
to listen. Molly was as careful as they would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">205</a></span>
be not to be intrusive. They would leave it to
her.</p>

<p>“Sakes, Jean, listen!” whispered Nan. “It’s
German.”</p>

<p>“<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">Meine Greta, meine Greta, meine Greta!</i>”
they heard repeated.</p>

<p>“Why, this must be where Greta lives,” said
Jean. “What’s <em>happened</em> to her?” Jean started
toward Molly, but Molly, her face alert, was
listening and waved Jean back. They heard a
sobbing outburst of German words that were
unintelligible to them.</p>

<p>“Molly knows German,” Nan reminded Jean,
and Jean nodded assent. Both girls were puzzled
and uneasy. There must be some reason
why Molly was listening where anybody would
think she had no right to be. There was a pause
and then another outburst of speech, as if the
person, a woman, were talking to some one,
even explaining. It was very curious. Then
the first expression, “<i>Meine Greta, meine kleine
Greta</i>,” was moaned, with “<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">liebchen</i>” and a few
other words that the girls knew.</p>

<p>“From the looks of Greta, I wouldn’t say that
she looked like anybody’s ‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">liebchen</i>,’” whispered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">206</a></span>
Jean. “She looks more like some poor step-child
to me.”</p>

<p>But Molly was picking a silent way back to
them. Her face was very sober now. She
waved them toward the gate, her finger on her
lips; and when she reached them she hurried
them out.</p>

<p>“I’ve heard something dreadful, girls, and we
must get out of sight as soon as possible, before
that poor woman has any idea that there was
any one there to hear her. Let’s get right down
to shore. Maybe some of the girls are out in
the boat and will see us and come for us. I
want to get away as quickly as I can. I’ll tell
you all about it as soon as I get over being
shocked. Isn’t Greta the name of that girl who
brings us things once in a while?”</p>

<p>“Why, of course, Molly. You know that.”</p>

<p>“Do I? I don’t know what I do know. There
she is now! And her boat is coming to this
landing! So I suppose that is where the Kleins
live.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I hadn’t thought of that, Molly. Yes,
it’s just about the location, I suppose, that
Jimmy said. You can see the peninsula from
here, of course.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">207</a></span>
The girls had reached the tree-sheltered
shore just as Greta sent her boat flying toward
them. “Wait,” said Molly, “I want to speak
to her.”</p>

<p>“You want to tell her what happened?”</p>

<p>“Yes, some of it.”</p>

<p>The girls approached the rude dock. Greta
smiled a real welcome, for to see the girls was
worth a day’s hard work. She lifted the children
out and told them to go on home; then
Molly laid a hand on her arm. “We stopped
to get a drink at a house up there. Is that
where you live?”</p>

<p>“Yes. That is what is left of the Klein farm.”</p>

<p>“Well, we have just been there. We walked
all the way back to the door, which was open,
but no one answered our knock. I was terribly
thirsty, so we went around the house and were
just going to get a drink when we heard some
one crying. I thought that somebody might be
hurt, so I stepped back to see. It was a large,
stoutly built woman, but she was not hurt, and
I think you ought to know what she said. Could
you meet us very early to-morrow morning?
Jean said that you were out early sometimes.”</p>

<p>Greta was impressed with Molly’s manner.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">208</a></span>
“Yes,” she answered. “Where shall I meet you?
Shall I come all the way?”</p>

<p>“If you can, and I will have breakfast for
you, too.”</p>

<p>“Oh, how kind you are! But I can’t be
dressed well enough. This is the best I have.”</p>

<p>“Some wouldn’t think that our middies and
bloomers were much in the way of clothes,”
laughed Jean. “Please come.”</p>

<p>Molly did not laugh, but she said, “I must
talk to you, Greta, and if you can come to us it
will be a favor, much easier than for us to come
out here, or near by. How soon can you come?”</p>

<p>“The earlier the better for me. I have to get
back to work before my mother gets around. I
take an early swim and bath in the lake. Then
I go back to do the feeding and milking, to get
breakfast and start the washing when we have
any.”</p>

<p>Molly seemed to know instinctively that
Greta could not get permission to come. “While
we talk, you can drink a cup of hot cocoa with
us and eat a plate of bacon and eggs with toast.
Then if you have to hurry back it is all right.
Come about five o’clock. We are planning an
early hike anyway. And it will be much better<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">209</a></span>
if your mother does not know that we were
there. Need you notice her tears?”</p>

<p>“I’ve seen her that way before, though not
very often, and I never speak of it. I did once,&mdash;and
I&mdash;was sorry.”</p>

<p>“All right. We’ll be looking for you. Nobody
but Jean and Nan will know why we want
to see you specially.”</p>

<p>Greta promised to come at five o’clock and
stay long enough for breakfast. The girls hurried
away, though Greta offered to take them
across in the boat. “Perhaps I will come by
boat to-morrow morning,” she said.</p>

<p>What could Molly have to tell her? Did she
mean that her mother talked to her? No, for
she said that it would be best for her mother
not to know that they had been there. It was a
mystery. But that it was important she was
sure. Her imagination was busy, but she could
not guess what it might be.</p>

<h2><a name="xvi" id="xvi"></a>CHAPTER XVI<br />
<span>SANS PEUR</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">Almost</span> before the birds Greta was up the
next morning. She had not slept well, for the
attic was hot. Not a breeze was stirring when
she loosed the boat from its moorings and
pushed out upon a lake that wore scarcely a
ripple. “We are due for a big storm if this
keeps up,” thought Greta. The air was oppressive
and clouds were gathering. Even the effort
of rowing brought the perspiration to Greta’s
brow, still tender from its hurt. She lost no
time, for there was a low rumble of distant
thunder and she did not want to be caught out
upon the water.</p>

<p>On the peninsula across from her the boys’
flag flew. Their cabin was partly concealed by
the trees between it and the lake. No one there
seemed to be stirring. Presently a breeze developed
and Greta bent, indeed, to her oars.
She must reach the little bay and the girls’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">211</a></span>
camp as soon as possible. But the clouds did
not seem to be heavier.</p>

<p>“There she comes, Molly!”</p>

<p>Three sober girls watched Greta make her
way around the curve in the lake shore and
steadily row toward them, stopping for one
little wave when she saw them.</p>

<p>“She is awfully strong, isn’t she&mdash;for all she
looks so pale and worn when she comes?”</p>

<p>“All that hard work would give anybody
muscles. Have you noticed her poor hands?”</p>

<p>“Yes, Jean; but they are not out of shape at
least.”</p>

<p>“No, just rough and her finger-nails are all
broken. I suppose the washing does it and I
don’t know what else she does, but she happened
to speak of doing that. She had a big
bundle of clothes in the boat last evening. How
are we going to manage this, Molly?”</p>

<p>“What do you mean, Jean?”</p>

<p>“Why, if you tell her before us, won’t she
feel worse? Suppose Nan and I make some excuse
and leave you with her?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no, Jean&mdash;please! I need support; and
besides, she admires you most of all. I can tell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">212</a></span>
You just slip an arm around her if she needs
one!”</p>

<p>“We’d better give her her breakfast first, for
fear she’ll be too stirred up to eat,” Nan suggested.</p>

<p>“Good idea, Nan. Your head is always level.”</p>

<p>“Then if that’s so, I’d better see about the
breakfast. You go down to meet her, Jean.”</p>

<p>Nan and Molly hurried in, while Jean went
down to the little dock to welcome their guest.</p>

<p>“I was a little afraid you might not come,
Greta, for it looks so much like a storm,” said
Jean, while Greta was fastening her boat
securely.</p>

<p>“I think that I would have come <em>in</em> a storm,
if there had been no other way. But it is a
good thing that I was to come early, I suppose.”</p>

<p>“Molly and Nan went in to hurry up the
breakfast. We had the milk heated and the
bacon cooked. There will be just us four to
have breakfast together. Grace took the rest
on a breakfast hike, but I’m afraid that they’re
going to get caught in a storm if they don’t
hurry back. We have two girls from our town
visiting us and that is the reason for the trip.
They are crazy to do everything and we are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">213</a></span>
crazy to show them everything we do. Nobody
slept much last night.”</p>

<p>“I’m afraid that you wanted to go with the
other girls,” thoughtfully said Greta.</p>

<p>“Oh, no. Especially after Molly told us what
she wants to tell you,&mdash;and we did not mention
it to the rest. But we’ll forget that now and
have a jolly good breakfast if we can. I’m not
sure but ice-cold lemonade would be better than
hot cocoa in this kind of weather,&mdash;funny to
have a hot night on our lake.”</p>

<p>If the cocoa was hot, it was bracing to Greta.
She sat at the yellow and brown and white
table, on a yellow, brown and white chair and
had her bacon and eggs served on the yellow
dishes decorated with daisies. “We are sibyls
in our club,” Molly explained, “and our colors
are yellow and white, but we aren’t what the
boys call ‘yellow,’ for our motto is ‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sans peur</i>,’
that means ‘without fear,’ and we’ve already
discovered that to have courage is one of the
most necessary things anywhere. Mine was at
a low ebb last night, I can tell you, but this
morning I’m all braced up.”</p>

<p>Jean looked at Molly with amused affection.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">214</a></span>
She understood how Molly dreaded to tell Greta
what she must.</p>

<p>Greta was bright enough to have an inkling
of what Molly meant. Her own courage was
sinking, and had been all night. What had
Molly heard? What new and dreadful thing
might she have to meet at home? Jacob Klein
had not come home the night before. Perhaps
it was something about him.</p>

<p>But the breakfast was good and the girls
were kind and interesting. She did not seem
to feel awkward with managing to eat before
them. Her mother had always made fun of her
“fussy ways,” as her German expressions
meant. A good breeze was blowing through the
big room and making them all more comfortable.
After the meal the girls left the
table as it was and took Greta outdoors to a
nook among the trees where they had fixed a
rope swing and some seats out of logs. On one
of these they sat down, though Nan presently
jumped up, saying that she’d better clear the
table, for the whole lot of girls would be back
soon, she thought. They all looked at the gathering
clouds. The storm seemed to be a long
time coming. Perhaps it would pass around<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">215</a></span>
them. In any event, Molly was thinking how
she would tell Greta and Greta was more interested
in what she was to hear than in the storm.</p>

<p>“Greta,” began Molly, “does <em>Mrs. Klein</em> treat
you kindly?”</p>

<p>Greta’s dark eyes looked soberly into Molly’s.
“I’d rather not say,” she replied. “Yes,
I will, too. It is a chance to tell some one. My
mother was good to me for a long time after I
had a bad sickness, and forgot things, they said.
Then she changed and although she would
never let Jacob Klein abuse me, she can’t care
much for me or she would never put the
heaviest work on me, even when she is well
enough to help more. I want to go away from
home to work, and I thought that perhaps you
girls could help me find a way, to help some
one with any kind of work; and then I could
send the money home to my mother and the
children. I heard her say when they were quarreling,
after Jacob Klein threw me against the
tubs and hurt my head, that he must leave me
alone and that I was not his child.”</p>

<p>All this came tumbling out rapidly, as if
Greta had planned it, which was not the case.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">216</a></span>
It was only that she was so full of her unhappiness
and puzzles.</p>

<p>“Did you ever think that perhaps you were
not her child either?”</p>

<p>Greta looked startled. Then she said, slowly,
“I thought that she might have been married
before and that my father might have had dark
eyes like mine. All the rest have blue eyes and
light hair, if you noticed, and the horse-doctor
that came to look after me as well as the horse
asked my mother where she found a little girl
with brown eyes. He was joking, but my
mother didn’t like it and said that families were
not always of one complexion, or something like
that. She talks mostly German.”</p>

<p>“I know,” answered Molly, who had heard
her. “I understand German, for we had a good
woman that helped us for a long time when one
of the children was little and Mother was not
strong. She started me because she loved to
talk her own language with some one, and I’ve
kept it up. But you haven’t a bit of a German
accent and talk English as well as we do. How
does it happen?”</p>

<p>“That is what I have been wondering about
for a long time. After this sickness I had to be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">217</a></span>
taught German, but could talk English. My
mother said that I had been bewitched,&mdash;that is
what it would mean in English. She taught me
to read the German newspapers that Jacob
Klein has,&mdash;I haven’t called him Father since
I found he wasn’t my father. Then I found
an old German Bible that I supposed was my
great-grandmother’s, from the date in it; but
it was Jacob’s grandmother’s, of course. There
is better German in that, and it has been a
help,&mdash;to stand things, I mean.” Greta’s eyes
filled with tears, but she dashed them away,
saying, “I’m sorry to complain this way to you.
Please do <em>not</em> tell any one.”</p>

<p>“I can’t promise that,” smiled Molly, “but if
you feel the same way after I tell you a few
things,&mdash;all right. But don’t you remember anything
that happened before this time that you
were sick?”</p>

<p>“I know that I have been at school somewhere,
and that I have seen people like you
somewhere and of course I am feeling pretty
sure that there is something queer about all
this. Why should I know these things if I had
always been with these people? Yet it has been
pretty well told me all about my mother’s people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">218</a></span>
and how my aunt Gretchen always thought
so much of me before she died and how my
grandmother said I would make a good little
worker and would help my mother.” Greta
stopped with a whimsical smile. “I have, all
right,” she added, “but I have had a chance to
talk English every summer with the people that
come to the cottages at the other end of the
lake, and this summer a lady gave me a lovely
book, all about girls like you.”</p>

<p>“Thank you for telling us about yourself,
Greta. Now let me tell you what I heard this
woman that you have been living with say.”</p>

<p>“‘This woman that you have been living
with’?” thought Greta. “What does this girl
mean?”</p>

<p>“She did not say much, and in the simplest
German, but she said enough to make me listen
to the rest,” continued Molly, going on to
describe the scene, telling how the girls happened
to stop at the place.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was Mother,” said Greta in reply
to Molly’s question, after a detailed description
of the woman whom she had seen.</p>

<p>“Well,” said Molly, “I saw a large stone by
some bushes. There was a sort of tangle in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">219</a></span>
that corner of the yard, near a pasture fence.”
Greta nodded. She knew. “There was an old
lilac bush and a syringa bush in my way, but I
peeped around them to see who was crying and
if anybody needed help. But here this woman
was lying, almost on her face, her hands
clutching the grass between some little bushes
that were planted in a row, Greta. Then it was
that I noticed the big stone in the corner and a
row of small stones that started from it as if
someone had been going to make a flower bed,
you know. These all must be to mark the place,
Greta.</p>

<p>“She was sort of moaning, in German, ‘my
Greta, my Greta, my little Greta,’ and then she
began to talk to her, just as I was going to slip
away, not to intrude; and she wasn’t hurt, I
could see. But she went on, ‘Your father never
meant to kill you when he hit you that time,
and I couldn’t see him hung, could I? So here
you are without a stone with your name on it
and not a prayer said over you when we hid you
here!’ She burst out sobbing loudly then, but
by that time I thought I ought to hear if she
said anything more, and presently she was asking,
‘Wasn’t it better for no one to know, when<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">220</a></span>
the little girl came and could take your place,
and her people were all dead in the storm?’”</p>

<p>Here Jean slipped an arm around Greta, who
was leaning toward Molly, listening tensely.
“Oh,&mdash;then the real Greta is buried there, and
I am the little girl!”</p>

<p>“Yes,&mdash;the ‘<i xml:lang="de" lang="de">kleines Mädchen</i>.’ When I got
home last night, Greta, I wrote down every
German expression that I could remember, so
I could swear to it if necessary. And I lay
awake thinking it out nearly half the night.
There wasn’t anything else, except that she
kept sobbing and repeating the little expressions
she had used, Greta’s name, and asking
if she blamed her mother. Did you ever
think that you might have been kidnapped?”</p>

<p>“Yes. I made a wonderful story about myself
and then I saw how silly it was. I even belonged
to the German or English nobility,
though as I couldn’t speak good German the
first wasn’t likely. But it must be true that my
people are dead in a storm, for anything that
my mother said in that way would have to be
true. Oh, to think of it! I knew I was different
and didn’t belong! I’d rather be all alone than
to be the daughter of that man&mdash;and poor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">221</a></span>
Mother! She isn’t very bright, girls, just
stupid about some things, and loves that dreadful
man! What can I do? Oh, thank you, Miss
Molly, for caring to tell me about it. It is a
wonderful thing for me that you girls came here
this summer!”</p>

<p>But Greta put her head in her hands, and
Jean patted her shoulder. “We’ll have to think
it out,” said Jean. “I told Molly that if it happened
in an accident, maybe the poor woman
wasn’t so bad to want to save her husband. But
what was worst was about you, especially since
you looked unhappy and tired out. Oh, yes,
Molly, you forgot to tell Greta one thing, how
she said she wasn’t making the girl that took
the real Greta’s place have a happy time and
was making her work for Greta’s little brother
and sister. She has some crazy idea like that!”</p>

<p>“As long as that grave is there, it could be
proved that I am not Greta, I suppose. At
least, they’d have to explain it.”</p>

<p>“But perhaps they could take,&mdash;take it all
away, if they had any hint that you knew,” said
Molly.</p>

<p>“That is so. I will have to go back and wait.
I always wondered why Mother had started a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">222</a></span>
flower-bed and those rose-bushes there, but I
never dared ask. I have a memory of a storm
in the woods, or it seemed like that.”</p>

<p>As Greta spoke, a blinding flash of lightning
was followed by a terrific crash of thunder.
“My sakes!” exclaimed Jean. “Let’s get inside.
Oh, I hope that the girls are almost
back!”</p>

<p>The three of them had been too much interested
in the story which Molly was relating to
notice how black the sky had become. Nan
rushed to the door to call them, but saw that it
was unnecessary. The bolt of lightning so near
had been sufficient warning. Greta went to
work with them to close all the windows and
door and drag the cots in from the sleeping
porch. The room presented a disheveled appearance
by the time they were through, but
they were concerned only with the storm. Jean
jumped with the next crash, but Greta, used to
taking care of frightened little children in
storms, smiled at her and took her hand, “What
did you say your motto is?” she asked.</p>

<p>“Thanks, Greta. I’ll remember, but I’m terribly
uneasy about the girls. If they had taken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">223</a></span>
the boat, they could get away from the trees.”</p>

<p>“But look at the lake, Miss Jean.”</p>

<p>“Just Jean and Molly and Nan, Greta,” said
Jean, as she looked out at an angry lake,
whipped by a wind. The trees were bending
now before a great wind. Whirls of leaves and
broken branches began to fly. Then Nan cried,
“Here they come,” and ran to open the door for
the fleeing girls, who ran through a blinding
downpour and against a strong wind.</p>

<p>“It’s a regular whirlwind, and I hear a terrible
roaring, girls,” said Grace, out of breath.
“Is everything closed tight?”</p>

<p>Nan, Jean and Molly were using their combined
strength to shut the door after the dripping
girls had come in, but Greta answered.
“We shut up everything, Miss French.”</p>

<p>There was nothing to do but to wait results.
By this time they all knew that a storm of more
than usual intensity was upon them. “‘<i>Sans
peur</i>,’ girls,” Grace reminded them, her chin
raised and her eyes looking out upon the
whirling scene outside. “I’m glad that we
reached shelter and are together.”</p>

<p>“I’m scared,” said Phoebe, “and I don’t care
who knows it!” She was standing by Leigh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">224</a></span>
Dudley, who had drawn a chair into the middle
of the room and had sunk into it as quite exhausted
after their mad rush through the
woods. Leigh reached up with a smile and drew
Phoebe down into her lap. “Sit down Phoebe-bird.
It doesn’t do any good to be scared, but
I’m not feeling any too safe myself.”</p>

<p>The two girls cuddled together and shut their
eyes, but Jean and Greta stood together, looking
out, and Greta whispered, “The good God
can save us if it is best.” Not in vain had Greta
read that German Bible.</p>

<p>Crash went a tree, just hitting the sleeping
porch, and the little house shook. But the worst
of the storm had passed them by in a few minutes
from the time they heard the roaring
sound, so rapidly was the work of destruction
done. It was wind rather than lightning which
had been the greatest menace. Pouring rain
continued for some time,&mdash;and then the sun
came out!</p>

<p>“Now is the time to be thankful, girls,” said
Grace, “but I hope that the boys are all right.
If I’m not mistaken, some cyclone went by us
and we’ll hear of damage done by it.”</p>

<p>Uneasily, the girls went about opening windows,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">225</a></span>
looking out to see what damage had been
done to the sleeping porch, or going out into
their cleared dooryard to see if their prettiest
trees had suffered. Branches lay on the ground,
whipped from the trees. It was a small elm
that had hit the porch. “Girls, if that tree
hadn’t been actually <em>lifted</em> by the wind, I don’t
believe it could have reached us,” said Jean.
“My father said that they particularly tried to
see that no tree could hit us if a storm felled it,
no big one, I mean. We have shade enough as
it is.”</p>

<p>The girls stood looking about. “I’m glad
that the boys built their shack in a pretty well
cleared place, too,” said Nan, who could scarcely
help worrying about Jimmy. Greta was
thinking of home and the children. They were
often rude to her, in the atmosphere of scolding
and criticism which made Greta’s life wretched.
But they also depended upon her for a great
deal and occasionally, when away from their
mother’s disapproval, showed her a little affection,
especially the youngest child.</p>

<p>Still excited by the character of the storm,
the girls ran around in the wet woods near by.
They found the tree which had been struck by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">226</a></span>
lightning before Nan, Jean and Greta had gone
into the house and they were startled to find
how near it had been. But when they looked
across the lake, beyond the camp’s small bay
and where the woods stretched toward Greta’s
home, they saw the most damage. Trees lay
prostrate near the shore. Branches and drift
tossed upon the still active waves. “I must
hurry home at once,” said Greta. “The storm
has gone that way.”</p>

<p>“I’ll go with you,” declared Jean, thinking of
the motto, for the thought of going frightened
her and she would have preferred to know what
had happened to Jimmy Standish, her friend,
Billy Baxter and the rest of the boys. But she
and Molly and Nan had gotten Greta into coming
for breakfast. If the family were unharmed
by the storm and Greta had a scolding or worse,
she would stand by her.</p>

<p>“I’ll go, too,” said Molly; but Grace heard
them.</p>

<p>“Wait, girls,” said Grace. “I think that I
hear the boys calling.”</p>

<p>The girls listened.</p>

<p>“Wah-hoo-oo-oo-oo-oo!” came the <a name="long" id="long"></a><ins title="Original has 'log'">long</ins>-drawn
call.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">227</a></span>
“Oo-ey, oo-ey, oo-ey,” answered Grace, all
smiles, for that was Jimmy.</p>

<p>In a few minutes several boys came crashing
through the bushes and brush, not caring how
the wet drops sprinkled them right and left.
“Everybody all right?” asked Jimmy, who was
in the lead, Billy Baxter right behind him. His
quick eyes took in Grace and Nan first and
traveled over the rest with some relief.</p>

<p>“Yes,” answered Grace. “No one was out in
the storm and the little cabin stood; but some
of us got inside just in time. I should have had
more sense than to go off for a hike and breakfast
when it felt like a storm, even if we did not
notice any signs when we left so early. I’ve
been wondering about you.”</p>

<p>“All of us have,” Jean added, “and Greta is
worrying about her folks across the lake. This
is Greta Klein. Greta, this is Nan’s brother,
Jimmy. He’s in charge at the boys’ camp, just
as Grace French is here.”</p>

<p>“I was certainly thankful to hear you call,
Jimmy,” said Grace, while Greta and Jimmy
acknowledged the introduction after a fashion,
for matters were on an informal footing. Jean
had merely announced facts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">228</a></span>
“We would have been around when it first
began to look like a bad storm, but we were off,
too, out of sight, on the other shore of the peninsula
to begin with, then ’way around in the
woods. Like you, we started early and there is
a little fisherman’s shack there. We made it to
our camp, though, but we had to stay till she
blew over then. As soon as we could, we ran
out where we could see your roof and it was
still on. So we hoped that you were all right.
Gee-whilikins, didn’t it get dark?”</p>

<p>“Jimmy brought ‘first aid’ and everything,”
said Dan Pierce. “Would Greta like to have us
go around with her?”</p>

<p>“That is a fine idea, Dan,” said Grace, and
Billy wished that he had thought of it. “I
thought of going around with Greta, as soon as
we knew about your camp. I was sure that you
would get some sort of a message through
pretty soon, unless you were all blown away.
Suppose you three boys come with Greta and
me, and maybe Molly, and Jean. They spoke
of going. Do you think that you could stand
it, girls, if anything has happened there?” This
question was spoken in a lower tone, for the
benefit of Jean and Molly only.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">229</a></span>
“‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">Sans peur</i>,’ Grace,” said Jean stoutly. “Get
Molly to tell you all about everything while we
go.”</p>

<p>“Couldn’t we go in the boats now?” asked
Molly, but caught herself short. “Oh, girls, we
never thought to look and see if the boats are
there yet!”</p>

<p>They were not, as the assembled company
soon found out when they ran around to the
lake side of the cottage. There was no sign
either of Greta’s boat or theirs. “Our canoes
were high and dry and under shelter,” said
Jimmy, “but the row-boats and the little motor
are goners as far as we know.”</p>

<p>“Some of them may turn up,” hopefully inserted
Billy. “Let’s go, Jimmy.”</p>

<p>“All right, kid, when the girls are ready. By
the way, Grace, tell them all to look out for
trees or branches that might be ready to fall.
We’ll have to go on the edge of the woods and
through it in some places, isn’t that so, Greta?”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir.”</p>

<p>Senior Jimmy smiled at the “sir,” then happened
to think. Yes, he was out of school, and
he’d be in the office with his father till he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">230</a></span>
earned enough money, in a year or so, to start
to college. Say, he was grown up, after all.</p>

<p>“Greta,” asked Molly, soon after they started
through the woods, “how old were you when
you were ‘sick’?”</p>

<p>“It was four years ago, and Mother says
that I am sixteen.”</p>

<p>“You don’t look any older than I do, and I’m
fifteen. Well, yes, you do look older in one
way, but then you’ve done so much hard work,
I guess.”</p>

<p>The going was difficult. They scarcely
stopped to examine the curious freaks of the
storm in the woods. Afterward they learned
that there was a comparatively small area damaged
by the “twister,” though the storm was
general. Jimmy said that he thought the
twister must have stooped and risen again, in
an erratic fashion, to fell some trees, take off
the tops of others and cut almost a path before
it in places.</p>

<p>It was some time before they came into sight
of the Klein house. There it stood, as ramshackle
as ever and with the additional loss of
the roof over Greta’s attic. As they reached
the road which ran between the woods and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">231</a></span>
place, Greta ran, the rest following as rapidly
as they could.</p>

<p>The yard was strewn with rubbish and a few
excited chickens ran about as Greta appeared;
but she dashed into the house, calling to see
where her mother and the children were. There
was no response. Greta looked anxious, as she
came from the rear of the house to say that no
one was downstairs.</p>

<p>Jimmy insisted on accompanying Greta upstairs
to see if they could be there, hurt, perhaps,
when the roof went off. They found the
attic pretty well demolished and the ceiling had
fallen in the bedroom below; but there were no
signs of any one having been there when it
happened. “We’ll look to see if the horse and
the old wagon are here,” said Greta, running
down the stairs and outdoors. “Maybe they
started away before the storm began. Mother
was very anxious last night and seemed to think
that&mdash;her husband&mdash;was in trouble.”</p>

<p>There lay the explanation of the absence.
Neither horse nor wagon were to be found. The
dogs were gone. The lone cow in the pasture
was unhurt. “She probably wakened up early,”
said Greta, “and just went to the village to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">232</a></span>
what had become of him. Thank you all for
coming with me. I’ll just wait here and
straighten up the best I can till they come. It
was a good thing they went, unless they might
have gotten caught in the storm.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we should leave you here
alone, Greta, to find out later what did happen.
Billy and I can walk across to the village and
find out if they are in any trouble. Where
would she be likely to go?”</p>

<p>“There is one woman there that Mother stops
to see when she goes to town. If there were
any trouble about&mdash;him&mdash;she would ask Mrs.&mdash;well,
let me write the name for you. It’s a long
German name. I hate to have you take all that
trouble, and the long walk after all your hiking,
too. I just don’t know what <em>to</em> do this
time.”</p>

<p>“We’re going, Greta. It is the only thing
to do.”</p>

<p>“I’ll make some coffee for you first.”</p>

<p>“No, we had breakfast and we’ll get something
in town. Honest, we’ll do it.”</p>

<p>The discussion came to an end suddenly, for
the attention of everyone was diverted by the
appearance of a light buggy and a toiling horse<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">233</a></span>
that was splashing through mud and water on
the dirt road. The man who was driving was
leaning out to look at the damage of the storm
and viewing with surprise the number of people
in the front yard. “Hello,” he called, “is
Greta Klein there?”</p>

<p>Greta came running forward to meet the man
who drove up, turned his wheel and clambered
heavily out of the buggy. Jean happened to
stand nearest and heard the most of the low
conversation that took place, though she
stepped back a little.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry to tell you, Greta, that your pa
was took sudden last night and your ma was
sent fur. She got up an’ took the little ones
an’ why she didn’t wake you up I don’t know.
Mebbe she isn’t quite right, fur she says that
you ain’t her child an’ she’s terrible upset becuz
he wuz gone when she got there. The children
wuzn’t half dressed an’ she wants their
clothes.”</p>

<p>“Does she want me to come?”</p>

<p>“No, but I would. That woman she stays
with says to bring you.”</p>

<p>Greta turned to Jean. Her face was white,
but her lips were set firmly. “I’ll have to go.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">234</a></span>
Did you hear what happened to Jacob Klein,
Jean?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Go and get ready and I’ll tell the
rest.”</p>

<p>Grace, however, stepped up to the messenger
and asked what his news was about Mrs. Klein.
“We are friends of Greta’s from a couple of
camps on the lake. She took breakfast with us
this morning and was kept by the storm.”</p>

<p>“Oh, she did. Well, all I have to say is that
it’s a good thing she has friends. If you know
anything about Klein you’ll know that what
happened was likely to happen to a man with
his habits. There was a terrible quarrel where
he was drinking and Klein was hurt. That’s
all I know except his wife’s ravings. She’s got
the hysterics, I think.”</p>

<p>“Is she likely to hurt Greta?”</p>

<p>“Oh, no. But she seems to have took a dislike
to Greta, they say.”</p>

<p>“I see.” Grace went into the house to see if
she could help Greta in any way. Greta was
trying to find the children’s clothes in the midst
of the destruction wrought by the fallen ceiling,
and hearing Grace’s footsteps, she looked out of
the door.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">235</a></span>
“Don’t try to come up, Miss French. I’m
finding their clothes and we can clean them up
when I get into town.”</p>

<p>“Well, I just want to tell you, Greta, to come
right to us at the camp if you need a place to
go. I don’t quite understand what the man told
me but it is clear that things are strange.”</p>

<p>“Yes, they are. Ask Molly and Jean and
Nan to tell you what they know. And after I
help Mother through this, I’ll be glad to come.
I want to find a place to work and the girls
thought they could help me.”</p>

<p>“We all can, Greta. Don’t worry.”</p>

<p>It was not long before Greta had been driven
away. She had locked the door and taken a
bundle of clothing with her. Cheerful waves
from the girls saw her off and Jean told her not
to forget to come to the camp as soon as she
could.</p>

<p>There was another long tramp back to camp,
for there was no boat to take them over, but
Grace invited the boys to stay for as big a meal
as they could get up on short notice. “Open
some cans of beans, Grace,” suggested Jimmy,
“and heat ’em up.”</p>

<p>“Beans it shall be,” laughed Grace, “but we’ll<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">236</a></span>
have some other things, too. Think it up, girls,
on the way.”</p>

<p>Camp, however, afforded a pleasant surprise.
There stood Mr. Standish and Mr. Lockhart in
front of the house, drawn there by the sounds
of arrival, and while Nan and Fran rushed
“madly on,” as Jean said, Mr. Standish came
from the house. “Oh, there you are!” she exclaimed
in relief. “We just got here and while
we saw that the cottage is all right, we were
worried to death for fear something had happened
to you. Your father and Mr. Lockhart
were just starting to the boys’ camp to see if
they were all right.”</p>

<p>“Here are Jimmy and Billy and Dan to tell
you all about the time they had,” said Nan, hugging
her mother. “We weren’t very scared,
Mother,&mdash;‘<i xml:lang="fr" lang="fr">sans peur</i>,’ you know, but we have a
lot to tell you about Greta Klein, a girl that
lives near here.”</p>

<p>“Got a big description of the storm for the
paper, Dad,” Jimmy informed Mr. Standish.</p>

<p>“All right. Write it up for me. I heard
about the storm up here and we had the edge
of it at home. Wires were down, so I thought
we’d better drive up. Such roads. We came<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">237</a></span>
over the shaky bridge and may have to swim
back.”</p>

<p>“In that case, I’ll stay with the girls,” suggested
Mrs. Standish, laughing. “It was an
awful ride, but I was thinking of you and the
girls and could not get here fast enough,
Jimmy. Where are the rest of the boys?”</p>

<p>“Back at camp, I suppose. We came up here
to see if the girls had escaped.”</p>

<p>Further explanations followed. Mrs. Lockhart
was found inside, where she had been setting
forth fruit and baked things of all sorts,
gathered up hastily when they decided to come.
Part of it was saved for the Wizards who were
at their camp, but the rest, with what the girls
had, made a great dinner that was eaten merrily,
though Mr. Standish offered a fervent
grace of gratitude at its beginning.</p>

<p>Jean and Molly gave a partial account of the
mystery about Greta. “She isn’t their child at
all,” said Jean. “It’s dreadfully sad, of course,
but not so bad for Greta as if they were her
parents and had been good to her. Greta is a
fine girl all right. She’s going to do everything
she can for them, I know.”</p>

<p>“Perhaps Mother could train her to help us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">238</a></span>
and she could go to school,” said Leigh. “I’m
glad that my father and mother are away, not
to be worried about the storm.”</p>

<p>“Me, too,” said Jean, “but the folks will be
back next week, I think.”</p>

<p>“We shall take good word to every one at
home,” said Mrs. Standish, “and if we can help
that poor child get a start, we will. <em>There</em> is
something for the S. P.’s to do.”</p>

<h2><a name="xvii" id="xvii"></a>CHAPTER XVII<br />
<span>THE MYSTERIES DISCLOSED</span></h2>


<p><span class="smcap">That</span> Jean Gordon would have any personal
interest in the mystery connected with Greta
was the last thing she would have guessed until
Greta came back two weeks later and appeared
at the door of “Sans Souci,” as the name over
the cottage door now announced.</p>

<p>Gently Greta knocked. Hesitantly she came
in, when several girls, who were doing the
morning work after what was a late breakfast,
called a happy, “Come in Greta! Glad you’re
back.” Molly ran up and took from Greta’s
hand a suitbox which she was carrying, probably
her substitute for a grip, Molly thought.
Impulsive Jean did more, running up and
throwing her arms around Greta. “Why, you
look like a twin sister to the S. P.’s now,” she
exclaimed. “Who fixed your hair that pretty
way? My, I wish I had curly hair!”</p>

<p>Greta laughed at this. “I fixed it, as much
like yours as I could,” she replied.</p>

<p>Grace, who had frowned at Jean’s too frank<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">240</a></span>
comments, now joined in the general smiles and
added her greeting. “Of course you have come
to stay a while with us, Greta?”</p>

<p>“Just a few days, Miss French, if you haven’t
already found some place for me to start working.”</p>

<p>“There will be no hurry, Greta. You need a
little vacation. The boys say that some one
else is moving into your house.”</p>

<p>“And we have seen from the lake that the
house is being repaired,” Nan added.</p>

<p>It took some time for all the explanations.
The Klein place had been taken over by the man
who had bought the rest of the farm land originally
attached to the few acres left. It was
rented now. Mrs. Klein and the two children
were starting for Idaho, where a sister lived.
“I am free,” said Greta, “though it was a hard
way for it to happen.”</p>

<p>To Molly and Jean alone Greta told the details
of her mother’s revelations. “She was
hysterical, as I was told, but by the time I got
there she was glad to have me take care of the
children. I think that she told them I wasn’t
her child so that I would have no share in the
little bit of property. She was that way. She
did <em>not</em> realize that all I wanted was to get
away!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">241</a></span>
“Of course, she did not say a word about how
her Greta died and I didn’t tell her what Molly
heard. There was no use in making her feel
worse than she did. She said that the night
Greta died there was a dreadful lake storm and
more than one boat went down on Lake Michigan.
Jacob Klein felt so terrible about losing
Greta that he walked and walked and walked
through the woods and clear across to Lake
Michigan before he knew it. I suppose he did,
for it’s only thirty miles or so, and he may have
had the horse or a boat at that. He never told
her the truth about anything. He wanted to get
away, and he could have taken one of the boats
and gone out by the river.”</p>

<p>“I think that it’s farther than you think,
Greta,” said Molly. “Were you ever there?”</p>

<p>“No. I wasn’t anywhere! But however that
was, he found me out in Lake Michigan, lashed
to something and unconscious. Isn’t it queer
that none of my dreams or flashes of remembering
had a boat in them? But I was afraid
of the water at first, till Jacob Klein made me
fish and told me to learn to swim. I found that
I did already know how to swim, when I made
up my mind to go into the water.</p>

<p>“We must have come part way through the
woods, for I partly remember being made to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">242</a></span>
walk and it seemed dark, though it must have
been just before daylight, from what Mother
said. I shall call her Mother till I get away
from here, Jean.</p>

<p>“Then Jacob told his wife that they would
take me in the place of Greta and that no one
would know the difference, even if I did not
look like Greta, for scarcely any one ever came
by; and if I didn’t go to school and they kept
me at home to work, nobody would know.</p>

<p>“I think that Mother expected me to ask some
questions there, for she hurried along and
made up a lot of things that couldn’t be so, only
that I was sick and they had a doctor come
from Milwaukee, instead of one from the town.
Jacob must have been good and scared to do
that; but even then I don’t see how it was managed.
If they had had any friends it couldn’t
have been. But it was no wonder people kept
away!</p>

<p>“She said that I might be able to find out who
my folks were, but she didn’t know and Jacob
tore up the paper that had the names of the
boats lost in the storm. She made over my
clothes for the children and I could wear
Greta’s then, but there were some coral beads
that she found inside of my clothes. The string
must have broken, she said, but a few beads<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">243</a></span>
were down my neck, and there was a handkerchief
in my coat pocket that she kept. She told
me where to find it and I went right back home
to get it. There is E. G. in indelible ink on the
handkerchief. It is a man’s handkerchief,
though.”</p>

<p>“G stands for Gordon,” said Jean, who had
been looking sober ever since the story of
Greta’s being found in Lake Michigan had been
mentioned. “I’m going to see if my father can
not find out something for you, Greta. It surely
will not be hard to find out what boats went
down in that storm. If you were lashed to
something it would mean that you were in some
wreck, you see.”</p>

<p>“I wish you had lost a sister, Jean,” smiled
Greta, “but I do hope that there will be somebody.
Still a whole family could be lost on a
pleasure boat, you know, and if I can work and
learn something along as I can, I shall be happy.
Can’t you learn without going to school,
Molly?”</p>

<p>“Of course you can, Greta. Oh, we ought to
give you a new name!”</p>

<p>“An S. P. name,” laughed Jean. “Say, Greta,
would you mind? Wouldn’t it be fun to make
up a name for you?”</p>

<p>“I’m sure I don’t mind.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">244</a></span>
“Sally, Stella, Serena, Sophia, Sophy, Sophronia,
Sara, Sidney,” began Jean. “Oh, for a
dictionary! We forgot to bring one out.”</p>

<p>“Think up a good one, Jean,” said Molly.
“It’s funny that she does look a little like you
with her hair parted on the side, the way you
have yours now.”</p>

<p>“But I’ll never have those natural curls,
Molly. It isn’t fair!”</p>

<p>“I’ll give you my hair any time you want it,”
asserted Greta, and although she smiled as she
said this, the girls knew that she would gladly
exchange any of her advantages for Jean’s.</p>

<p>“I have it,” said Jean, suddenly, “Sybil, of
course. She will be our S. P. sibyl. It was stupendous
stupidity in me not to think of that at
once.” Nan and Phoebe, who had just joined
the group of three, agreed at once with the fact
of Jean’s stupidity and Jean pretended to be
deeply offended. But they were interested at
once when Jean said that this sibyl would find
her own fates instead of telling other people
theirs.</p>

<p>The story of Greta’s substitution for the real
Greta was soon told to them all, disagreeable
facts like those Molly had overheard all
omitted. “He probably worked over me when
he found me half drowned in Lake Michigan,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">245</a></span>
girls,” said Greta, anxious to do justice to poor
Jacob Klein. “So I do owe my life to him, and
it was probably the liquor that made him&mdash;the
way he was.”</p>

<p>Greta was a happy girl to sleep on an extra
cot kept for guests and to have her sharing
in the gay doings taken as a matter of course.
She so insisted upon doing more than her share
of little tasks that Jean dubbed her the “Relief
Corps” and told Grace that she might just as
well let Greta help whoever had charge of meals
for the week. But they began to call her Sybil
until she said that she knew that magic had been
worked and that she was a different person altogether.
“Well,” said Nan, “since you are
really not Greta at all, Sybil is as much your
name as that. You are probably a sort of nice
pixy. And that makes me think, Jean, the boys
are now calling us the Sibyl Pixies!”</p>

<p>With the rest Sybil went to a great picnic
celebration gotten up by the boys, and Billy
asked Jean what the girls had done to her to
make her look so different.</p>

<p>“We have not done anything, Billy, except to
make her have happy times. It’s that she has
some respectable clothes now and doesn’t have
to kill herself working. The village women
must have shamed Mrs. Klein into getting her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">246</a></span>
a decent dress for the funeral and the neat skirt
and middy and sweater that she has for every
day is as good as anything we are wearing out
here. She told me that she borrowed the money
for those, but that they didn’t cost much in the
little town.”</p>

<p>“Poor kid! Isn’t it awful what some are up
against?”</p>

<p>“Yes; and I never thought about it before.
I’m always going to think more about other
girls and not take everything for granted after
this. By the way, Billy, I’ve a lot to tell you
some time.”</p>

<p>“Why not now?”</p>

<p>“Because we have to play games and things.
Wait till we get home. I have something on
hand now that is very exciting. Could you keep
a secret?” Jean’s eyes were dancing and the
dimple was in evidence.</p>

<p>“Try me.”</p>

<p>“I haven’t said a word to Molly or Nan or
any of the girls, for fear Sybil might get a hint
and then have her heart broken.”</p>

<p>“What on earth do you mean?”</p>

<p>“Right away, Billy, as soon as Sybil said that
Jacob Klein took her out of Lake Michigan, I
thought of that awful summer when my uncle’s
whole family were in a dreadful storm and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">247</a></span>
wreck. They were going to visit us and they
never came at all. Don’t you remember about
it? Mr. Standish had a piece in his paper about
it. Uncle Everett and Aunt Fanny were saved
and the two little twin boys, but a girl about my
age, mind you, Billy, and a baby, were just
swallowed up some way, though they found the
little baby. Wouldn’t it be strange if Sybil
were Uncle Everett’s child? If she is, her name
is Ann Gordon.”</p>

<p>“Say! But things don’t happen that way,
Jean.”</p>

<p>“<em>Why</em> don’t they? She has to be somebody,
doesn’t she? And maybe I was sent up here to
find my cousin. I wrote a letter to Daddy right
away, all about it and when it happened, as
nearly as Sybil could tell from what Mrs. Klein
said. I’ll let you know when I hear. Perhaps,”
Jean added impressively, “everybody will know
very soon, if it turns out that way!”</p>

<p>But Jean herself was surprised when, before
she thought her uncle could possibly have heard
from her father, out came the Gordon car with
a lady and gentleman whom she had never seen,
her uncle and his wife. Sybil was not there, but
Jean was, almost afraid that she had done
something she should not when she finally realized
who had come. “Oh, perhaps I’ve made a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">248</a></span>
big mistake,” she cried, “and then you will be
so terribly disappointed!”</p>

<p>“Jean,” said the quiet gentleman who was
Uncle Everett, “for four years I have gone to
every place where I heard of a child’s having
been found and adopted. You would be surprised
to know that there have been several
children saved from wrecks on the big lake.
This is only another chance, though, more
likely, for we were not so far from that shore,
but there was no report of anything but wreckage
found there. Your father telegraphed.
Fanny wanted to come with me, to see if she
knew the beads you mentioned, and here we
are.”</p>

<p>There was a little time of waiting before
Sybil, the unknown, came in from the woods
with the other girls, all laughing and happy.
Never did she look more like Jean than when
with eyes alight, she handed Jean a branch
which held a little humming-bird’s nest, like a
lichen-covered cup. “It was broken off by the
storm, Jean,” she said; and then she saw that
they had company. “Oh, excuse me,” she said,
stepping back.</p>

<p>But “Greta Klein” had not changed so much
in four years that her own mother did not know
her. “Ann,&mdash;Ann-girl,” said Mrs. Everett<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">249</a></span>
Gordon, rising at once from her chair and walking
across the big room as if there were no one
there but herself and the girl who was staring
at her with startled eyes. “Oh, what have they
done to my little girl all this while! Don’t you
remember, Ann?”</p>

<p>One by one the girls began to slip out of the
room. It was very confusing to the girl who
had been Greta Klein as she thought. Even
Jean deserted her, and here were a gentle lady
and a kind man, who held her close by turns and
scarcely said more than her new name, Ann,
Ann and Ann again. Best of all she knew them
for her own. “Oh, yes, it’s you, Mother! I
know! Please take me home, Father!”</p>

<p>It was not necessary to look for the identifying
beads and handkerchief. Ann had changed
very much, her mother said, in height and expression,
but the face could not be mistaken.
Nothing but some disfigurement could have
made her hard to recognize at once. Mr. and
Mrs. Gordon could scarcely bear to have her out
of their sight. Jean protested against her being
taken away at once, but Ann drew Jean’s
arm within her own as she said, “Suppose you
had just found your father and mother again,
Jean, wouldn’t you want to see home with your
own eyes? I’ll never forget what you girls<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">250</a></span>
have done for me and my father says I may
come back; but I have two little brothers, Jean.
Think of it! I will write you all about it.”</p>

<p>With this Jean was satisfied. In a whirl of
cheery goodbyes the Gordon car took them all
back to town and the train. “My,” said Jean,
“doesn’t it seem lonesome without Sybil?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” Grace answered, “yet she was here
only two weeks. Do you realize, girls, that the
time I have to spend here is getting short?”</p>

<p>The vacation was flying, as Grace said, but
when Grace felt that she must go back, there
were several tired mothers that thought a short
vacation would do them considerable good.
They were welcomed as chaperons by the S. P.’s
and not allowed to cook or lift anything but an
admonishing finger. By this time, moreover,
the S. P.’s could “really cook,” as Jean put it.
The advent of the mothers, one by one, prolonged
the camping until within a few weeks
before school began; then the beloved cottage
was dismantled and the caravan of campers returned.
The boys had gone first, but some of
them came back to help the girls pack up.</p>

<p>Billy persuaded Jean to ride on the truck
which Jimmy drove, with Grace beside him.
He fixed a safe perch and sat beside her to hear
the latest, he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">251</a></span>
“Well, Billy, the latest is that we are really
the Social Progress Club, announcing our name
to everybody, and that we think the Sibyl Pixies
a clever idea of you boys. The only thing
secret will be our initiations; so that that mystery
is over. But the great mystery of the
S. P.’s was the one we didn’t expect at all, the
one that made Ann Gordon out of Greta Klein!
Sure enough, I <em>did</em> go up there to find a cousin.
Suppose we hadn’t gone camping. Suppose we
hadn’t had a S. P. Club!”</p>

<p>“You would have gone East with your father
and mother, and Leigh would have gone somewhere
with hers, and Molly,&mdash;well, you would
have been scattered.”</p>

<p>“And oh, Billy, I’ve something to confess to
you. I’ve just dreaded doing it, but I have to,
for the sake of my little conscience!” Then Jean
started in to tell Billy all the details about how
she started the S. P.’s. Fortunately, Billy did
not take it as seriously as she feared, though
she did not spare herself. He doubled over with
mirth when she told him how she saw the S. P.
on a sign as they passed.</p>

<p>“You can tell the other boys if you want to.
I deserve it. There was a real club, though, by
the time they heard of it. But I made you think
that <em>there had been one</em>. It’s taken me a long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">252</a></span>
time to bring myself to telling you, but I had
to be straight with myself, anyway. Whatever
happens, I’m going to stick to the straight up
and down truth forever!”</p>

<p>Billy was a little embarrassed by Jean’s earnestness,
but as Molly had once said, he was
both level-headed and fair.</p>

<p>“So far as I’m concerned, it’s all right, Jean.
You’ve fixed it up with your little conscience,
so forget it. I don’t blame you, for I suppose
I was blowing about our pin that I was showing
you. I had to show somebody or ‘bust,’ I
reckon. Jimmy’s taken a lot of that out of me
this summer. Let’s draw a long breath and
start in, Wizards and S. P.’s, to raise money
for the new library. You’re great on thinking
things up, Jean. Get up some good schemes and
I’ll back you.”</p>

<p>“Thanks, Billy. It’s a great relief that you
don’t think that so terrible. And speaking of
schemes, Uncle Everett says that he will give
a contribution to the S. P.’s for any cause they
like. My cousin Ann writes to me, you know.
They are not rich, but so happy. I’m to go
there on my Christmas vacation and Ann is going
to be an S. P. So are a lot of other girls
if they will join us.”</p>

<p>But Billy was laughing over a thought of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">253</a></span>
own. “Think of all the names we boys made
up for you, and all the time you were trying to
fit something to S. P. and rousing our curiosity!”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry about that, Billy, but the S. P.
mysteries are all over, though it is almost a
pity. And our greatest find was Greta-Sybil-Ann.
I’m not so sorry, after all that I started
the S. P.’s. Even if Ann might have found her
parents in her own way, she would never have
known the ‘why,’ if it hadn’t been for Molly,
and we hurried up the happy ending, or beginning,
just by being on hand. My! You never
can tell what’s going to happen when you start
<em>anything</em>!”</p>

<p class="noi">Rewarded for good work in school,
the seven girls of the S. P. club
are given a cottage on a little lake
where they are to spend the summer.
Greta, a poor German girl
who lives near by, arouses their
sympathy, and they try to help her.
A storm damages Greta’s home,
and her father dies in a drunken
fight. Then her mother acknowledges
Greta is not really her child,
and the girl dimly recalls her childhood.
One of the girls writes her
father about Greta, and she is identified
as the lost child of his own
brother.</p>

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or

or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
